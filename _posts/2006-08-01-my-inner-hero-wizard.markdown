<p>There are many types of magic, but all require a sharp mind and a cool head.  There is no puzzle I can't solve, no problem I can't think my way out of.  When you feel confused or uncertain, you can always rely on me to untangle the knots and put everything back in order for you.</p>

<em>Hello, Wizard.</em>

<h4>Character Stats:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rogue (9)</li>
<li>Warrior (14)</li>
<li>Wizard (17)</li>
<li>Paladin (10)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Profile:</h4>

<p>You're intelligent, educated, and just a bit superior to everyone you know. If you're still in school, you probably make A's, if you're not too bored to waste the effort. If you work, your annoying boss relies on you to solve the problems no one else can figure out. You've never met a puzzle you can't solve. When it comes to leisure, you'd rather read, play a strategy game, or surf the 'Net than run around getting sweaty. You're a brainiac, and you're not ashamed to admit it.</p>

<p>Above all, you're a mastermind and a great thinker. You see the unknown as territory to be conquered, and the mysterious as something to be systematically unraveled. You don't have time for fools; you only spend your time with people who can comprehend your obfuscatory convolutions. You enjoy amassing knowledge, both useful and trivial.</p>

<h4>Your Mission:</h4>

<p>You were put on this earth to enlighten people. They will listen to you, because they are impressed by your vocabulary, your erudition, and your ability to grasp concepts that invariably elude them. You are the one who has to figure things out, because let's face it - you're the only one smart enough.</p>

<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to Discover Something. Something small, or something big. Find an unknown insect in your own backyard. Discover a cure for sunburn. Develop a faster way to get the dishes done. Calculate the number of molecules in the Andromeda galaxy. Discover a comet. Discover SOMETHING.</p>

<p>And do make it a priority. The Famous Adventurer of Silmaria has a crystal ball trained on you, and will be noting your progress.</p>

<h4>A Warning:</h4>

<p><strong>Try to remember:</strong> you're not infallible. If people around you are all nodding and smiling, it may just be because they don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about. Check your facts and admit the possibility that even you can make mistakes. Loosen up. Make friends with a Rogue and have him or her try to poke holes in your theories. Who knows; you might actually have fun.</p>

<p>On another note - making plans and formulating theories can be quite stimulating, but at some point, you are going to have to actually DO something. Employ a Warrior, if necessary, to put your brilliant schemes into action. Just be sure your instruction manual is written in very small words.</p>

<h4>What Next:</h4>
