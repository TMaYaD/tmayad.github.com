<blockquote> I knew she meens "I don't wanna talk to you.", and I was right. </blockquote>
<em>Was I?</em>

<p>I don't know. That girl just walked upto me today at dinner time and said she wants to talk to me. I was aghast. I didn't know what to say. My friends were coming behind me to have dinner and I can't just turn them down(even if they say it is better without me, I know they wouldn't appreciate it.) and sit and chat with this girl. OK! That is not the exact reason I told her. "I have a presentation tomarrow, so...", I said, " ..may be later!?". But truth be told I wanted to take my time in guessing what is it that she wants to talk to me. If she really meant what I wanted to talk to her, she could have replied to my mail, called me, sent an SMS or something like that.</p>

<p> Why did she walk upto me only after accidentally coming across at the food court.  Does she intend to threaten me, about all this ranting? Looks more probable considering that she screwed up a guy in food court similarly for irritating her. But what is she gonna threaten me about? I guess she knows that I don't give up even if I'm afraid. So maybe this is not so probable as it appears in the first glance. May be she doesn't wanna threaten but ask me to stop all this nonsence all the same.</p>

<p>I think I have answers for all these questions. But I don't intend to post them here lest she would be reading these blogs. I don't wanna give her the advantage in our conversation.</p>
