<p>By the time I came back from vacations, my corner room has taken a heavy deal of downpour and turned dampy. A lot of fungus took away my pillow and other stuff. My PC too was in a big trouble. Among many others my keyboard wasn't working properly, and then stopped working all together. Then the mouse followed the suit. Then after a lot of procrastination I gave them for warrenty last week and now I got another set :). I don't think it is new.. I haven't read the Logitech policy on replacements but Timex and Seagate says explisitly that either my goods are repaired or they will be replaced with throroughly repaired and verified equipment that came for servicing just like mine.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that kept me from blogging all these days. Some serious, some lazy. But I think I'm back. I'll try to keep it as up to date as possible. And while we are at it I moved over to blogger beta along with many others. So there is going to be a little rework of the blog template and stuff. Also, I plan to update the old posts with tags slowly when I get time. And please do head to my profile and check out my other blogs as well.</p>
