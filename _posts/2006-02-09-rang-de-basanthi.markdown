<p>There used to live a lion in a jungle, the king of the jungle like in all stories. One summer evening it went to a stream to drink water. There it saw a little lamb playing cheerfully in the water a little distance away on the other bank.<br />
Lion shouted, "Why are you spoiling my drinking water?"<br />
For this the lamb replied, "Sir, How can that be possible? I'm down stream and you are upstream!"<br />
Hearing that the lion went mad and roared, "You are calling me names."<br />
The lamb pleaded, "Sir, I haven't said a word"<br />
"Not now, but last year you did."<br />
"It can't be me, sir. I was born only this spring!!!"<br />
"Then it must be your mother, it doesn't matter.", saying so the lion jumped across the stream........</p>
