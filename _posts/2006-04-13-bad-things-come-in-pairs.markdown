<p>Here is how it all started. First of all I lost my room key.</p>
<p>I was browsing the net and found out that there is a new firmware update to my phone. I went to food court and when I opened my phone I didn't find the stylus. Dropped it somewhere.</p>
<p>I almost completed the user part of our sen after two sleepless nights. I designed the project and I was taking care ofmost of the coding. I got it well layed out with work devided to everyone who does any coding in a clear cut fashion and asked them not to touch others' work. I thought people would mess up but wasn't aware of the fact that some one could be so dumb that she could actually disregard clear instructions in plain english and destroy my entire work without touching her own. Entire work gone "puff..." without even smoke.</p>
<p>Yesterday I got my bike repaired and serviced. I was bringing back my bike and meet with this accident. All the complaints I initially had came right back and a few more new ones. As a bonus, I lost my Sun glasses too.</p>
<p>After the servicing is done, I withdrew money, some 5k, from Sandeep's account. As he owes me upwards of 2.5k, I thought I can rest without money troubles for a while now. Last night I checked the accounts and cross checked it with the cash in purse and slept, only to find that the purse was stolen right from my table draw no more than just a foot away from my bed. And to realise that I slept as if I was drugged only today for 14hr whereas it's only 2-4hr any other day, call it fate?</p>

<p>After all this its natural for someoneto be really upset I guess. So was I. Kanthi was online and I thought a chat could cheer me up. She was as cheerful as ever. We were talking and she is being silly. Something I would have really liked but in all the frustration, I called her 'nuts'. Damn me. I bet she felt bad. I didn't even apolagise as she went offline right after. Okay! When I got time to say bye, I got time enough to say sorry but I wasn't really about to. I'm really making things worse.</p>
