<p>Just a couple of minutes back, I was commenting on a blog post, which at best can be described as personal life and routine. The post was so good that I thought I should appreciate the author and leave a comment adding my two cents. I thought I should because comments on my blog makes me happy. :) knowing that there is some one out there reading and generally interested in my otherwise brilliant but monotonous-for-most-part life. All is well and good till there. What I suddenly realized was that the comment ran with only one central theme. 'Me', on the topics she touched. I didn't know what else to write, I don't know the person personally to add anything to it. I don't think I'm a judge enough to give advises or know enough to make suggestions.</p>

<p>But still, why should the theme be 'me'? Why is it that, the thoughts that jumped into my head are about 'me'? Am I so self centered. If I leave the same content as my blog post, that would be perfectly well. This is my blog and my life. But how can I be justified, if-et-all I could be justified, to brag about my self on some body else's blog? What would they be thinking? This isn't the first time I did this. If you are one of those (hopefully not) abused by me, please frankly let me know what you thought. Leave a comment. ;)</p>

<em>Thank you.</em>
