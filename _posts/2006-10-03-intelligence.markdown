<p>Knowledge is the answer to the question 'why?'. Knowledge, as they say, is wealth. But what use is any wealth that can't help us? That brings us to another question -- 'how?'. How do I do this? How do I do that? How does the chicken cross the road? How on earth am I going to write an essay on intelligence? ;) etc etc etc. Now answering those requires intelligence, esp. more so if you are pretending to answer that last bit.</p>

<p>'How?' So where does the answers come from? From our knowledge of course! We compile that knowledge with a little bit of creativity and get new 'solutions' to the problems. Or... do we? The Zen says that there is nothing like a problem and the solution. Everything is the same. The object and subject is one and the same. Then what are these so called solutions? They are nothing but a perspective of the problem. And the intelligence is the way of looking at 'knowledge'</p>
