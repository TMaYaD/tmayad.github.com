<p> As you can see, I tried to make my template more readable after recieving one too many comments about the contrast. But it's no good I guess. I can't find a color for text that goes well with the darkness of night and the moon too. Any suggestions are welcome!! In my infinite wisdom, ;) I recollect that girls seems to have expertise in color combination (Just look at all those matching centers in besent road). So any girl out there who could help me?</p>
