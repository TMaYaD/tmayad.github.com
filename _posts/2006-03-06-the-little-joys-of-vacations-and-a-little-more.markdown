<p>Much happened last two days. First dad went to Roorkey and I got the car all for my self. Ofcoarse he did put a few restrictions though, as if I would stick to them! Like Morpheous puts it, "Some rules can be bent, others... broken!". </p>

<p> Kanthi Called me last night at about ten. She studied with me till 7th. Then her parents got transferred and shifted to Hyderabad where she presently lives. She wanted to meet us old friends. So I took the car and drove to Vijayawada club at 2230hr. We talked for a while and she had to leave. She is supposed to start for hyd today morning. I learned later that they went for a long drive and it was 0200 by the time they went home.</p>

<p>Today morning started lazily. Woke up and sat before TV surfing channels for something worth watching. The phone rings and its her again. She is still in the city and wants to meet. She said she would call others as well and call me again in an hour. Oh! I guess I have to get ready. After I took bath for a little short of an hour and a half, she calls me and asks me to come to Corn Club.</p>

<p> This place isn't that great. Can call it good, yet I wouldn't prefer it for it's high cost. Anyways, I ended up at the hang out fifteen min. later and sipping chocolate shake. Swathi is there too and Sindhu is missing (She went to college.) We chat a little and Kanthi wanted to visit the school. I offer to take them and so its all decided.</p>

<p>From there we went to school met a few teachers we know and a senior, Bhanu Sree (She is another classmate Phanish's sister). We come back and I dropped her off at her house after making a short visit to Swathi's home and dropping her off. Here's a pic of Kanthi I took with the 7710.</p>

<em>Cute!!! Ain't she?!</em>

<p>She is a real beauty! And talks like a parrot too. So sweeet!
<br /><strong>Congrats Praveen, you are really lucky. Congrats to you too, dear friend.</strong></p>

<p> <strong><em>edit 200603080723 : </em></strong> It occured to me last night that I never mentioned that she is engaged. Praveen is her fiance name.</p>
