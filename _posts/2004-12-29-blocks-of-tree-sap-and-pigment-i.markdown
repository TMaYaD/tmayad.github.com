<p>I haven't ever written a review of any book. I'm not much into reading for that matter. I hardly glance through my own god forsaken text books if I ever buy them. I seldom get/install a reader or unzip the e-books I ever download. But there are still a few novels I read, by the brilliance of fate. I've read the sherlock holmes, The harry potter, and lately started with The Fountain Head, after a friend referred to it.</p>

<p>The last one by Ayn Rand apparently prompted this post but one should realise that it contributes so little in this plea or cry whatever you would like te call it. Any how we will see about it later.</p>

<p> The first novel I ever read was The dead man's doller, an e-book on digit/chip CD  It's just a string of incidents and the authers imagination. There is nothing I see in that work to talk about.</p>

<p> But then comes The great Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I read through the three volumes of it and it would be pure injustice if I don't mention How much I enjoyed that time. I should accept that the book merely allowed me to use it for the purpose I intended it for, to pass time.</p>

<p> What it really lacks is the originality of the work. Mind you, I'm not saying that it is copied or something. But the auther, 'sir' Arthur Canon Doyle, hyped too much. Through out the entire three volumes it's always the same monotony. It starts with seemingly innocent details. I had the feeling that the auther purposefully hides the details to demonstrate that we can't understand the details as good as Mr.Holmes. Then Mr.Holmes, with all his (un)natural talent lables them grotesque and start after them. Then with his ingenious techniques finds great many details of the case. The auther, with all his brilliant literary talents, always avoids the actual techniques , if there are any, very successfully. It appears to me as a big hoax.</p>

<p><i>There has been a long gap on my blog. So I decided to put up this incomplete post. I'll complete it the next time I find time.</i></p>
