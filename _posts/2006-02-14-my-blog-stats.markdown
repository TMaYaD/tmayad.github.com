<p>Saw the blog stats today and found some interesting facts. Firstly, apart from direct referrals (read 'forcing my friends into visiting'), the highest visits come from various searches made for wetlook, for <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2005/07/wetlook-do-i-have-to-say-more.html">this post</a> and I don't even know what these guys areactually looking for. Apart from that, there is a hit from yahoo search results for <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=mahishasura%20mardhanam&ei=UTF-8&fl=0&fr=FP-tab-img-t">"mahishasura mardhanam"</a>. Its in a <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2004/09/spicmacay.html">post</a> I have written about a SPICMACAY event.</p>

<p>That isn't everything. I was really flattered when I found <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=new+hero+for+warcraft&svnum">this</a>. Scroll to the bottom of the page or select large images only. Hey it's <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2005/04/making-of-new-warcraft-hero.html">me, new hero for warcraft</a>. [:))][B)] </p>
