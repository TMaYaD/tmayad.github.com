<p>The Laptop is running OSX86. Observe closely and you should make out the dashboard( cuz I told you so). The PC behind it is running Win# on the CRT monitor to the extreme right. The CPU below that one is not working then and made a lot of fuss till I fixed it with a little of my magic.The PC on the desktop connected to the LCD is on <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">LFS</a> and XFCE that I rarely use. I prefer to work on console.</p>
<p>BTW, this is my PC. Check out my Logitech Dinova keyboard and mouse. Keyboard is on the desk and mouse is in my hand on the laptop. The mouse on my keyboard and the keyboard on my legs belong to the other PC. Switched them to match the colors in the pic ;) </p>
<p>The rest of them were brought in for some maintainance or the other (mainly OSX86 install, hottest thing on my list). I bet if I start charging for my support work I needn't buy my lunch any more. I don't think I'll earn enough to buy dinner too, and no way near my chocolate expences. (Yummy, gotta buy one right after this post.) I believe that is gonna get me less clients and I'll have more time for other work, like... study for a change. But for the hell of it, I love these tweaks hacks and trouble shooting. I'm actually in a fix. I'm going to stop these support calls for some time and see if people are really willing to pay me. Meanwhile I can study for my midsems from monday and work on that long due paper. If people really need me and are willing to pay me, I'll start charging them. Seriously! I'm gonna do that.</p></div>
