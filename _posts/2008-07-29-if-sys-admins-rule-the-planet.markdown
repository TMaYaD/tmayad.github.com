Welcome to rant central. The center of today's rant is the IS team. Don't get me wrong here. Most of the IS team is friendly and quite cool to begin with. But at the end of the day I would rather do it my self than have them help. It doesn't have anything to do with the technical prowess. They are quite good. But tolerance wise they score pretty low. If they can't stand my wierd ass ideas and think pitching in to the rescue when I get into a jam is eating their time, I absolutely fail to see any 'support' in them. Sorry, I don't mean they aren't. It might just be me failing to see it.

"Dude, what happened to all that you-are-the-admin-of-your-system talk?"
