<pre style="font-style:italic;">
With all these thoughts filling up my mind,
like poisoned needles, slowly and delicately
making my head heavier than lead.
I can't write anything more.
With every thought, the thread is lost.
I don't find solitude in words anymore.
I wonder weather I'm existing still or gone for the good.
So that's it chaps, more if I ever make it back.
