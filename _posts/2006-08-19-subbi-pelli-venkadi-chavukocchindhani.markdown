<p>The much tauted wedding of the millennium is over last night. Now technically my latest crush is a married woman. What next?</p>

<p>This blog is cynical, right? So here goes the rants. First I wanted to look good at the wedding. So I went to a saloon and the barber trims my hair really short and like a mushroom on my head. I go for bath and the water tank runs dry after filling the bath tub. I search for clothes and realize I have none ironed and have to press them myself. I ask for car and it runs into trouble at the petrol bunk, and a friend is with me. Poor thing, I hate dragging her into such situation. I have to push the car to get started and get drenched in sweat only to realize I forgot my deo. Luckily nothing went wrong at the marriage and I must really rejoice for that.</p>
<p>And a final touch, Heard Indu came for the wedding but left shortly before we were there. Darn the damn car!!</p>
