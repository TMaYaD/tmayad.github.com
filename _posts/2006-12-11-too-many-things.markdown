<p>Too private to put on the blog. Shall let you know when I can. :)</p>
<p>As for rest of the stuff, I'm done with exams. D in the one I wrote best. And still awaiting rest of the results, expecting an F for sure and possibly two more (out of four exams in total). Of course I'm disturbed. But nothing I can do about it now. Don't even try preaching me. You think I don't know all that? I know. But I'm too weak to fight my own short comings. To refine (or what ever the word might be) my self. I got used to standing idle and seeing things like a spectator and giving up became a habit. sucks I know.</p>
<p>On second thoughts, say what ever you want. But do not expect any explanation from me.</p>
<p>Then, after we are done with that, I'm back home for vacations and wish I weren't. Stupid fights. Mostly my ego again. Or may be not. I really don't care. Everyone says, I'm an asshole. I might be. But I can't say that. Again, I don't care. Put in other words. I'm too lazy to bother.</p>
<p>Okay, now I'm too lazy to continue the post.</p>
