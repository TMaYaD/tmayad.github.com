<p>I didn't blog for long. There are a lot of reasons for it. While Couter Strike addiction apparently killed most of the time there is more subtle reason besides procrastination for that. I landed my self in trouble. That's what. Some might scoff at me for all this stupid stuff that no one would be interested in. But I feel better by ranting, By writing about it, By crying...</p>

<p>yes, I cry even at the age of 20. I cry like a baby. I cry when I feel helpless. The feeling that something is impossible gives me creeps. I'm positively horrified by anything impossible.</p>

<p>Here's what had happened....<br />
There is this cousine of mine studying with me in the college. She is kind of too much modern for me(may be I'm too ortodox for her but it doesn't matter, this is how <em>I</em> percieve). She got a new boyfriend. I didn't believe it when my friends commented. Esp. after fighting and frightening a couple of guys, I thought she would stand for ethics even if she is very outgoing. But I never expected she would <em>fall</em> for some stupid. So naturally(for me atleast) I thought I better warn her to think twise b4 she londs herself in any commitment.(no threat intended) May be I'm a paranoid but I don't believe in these college campus love stories and I have pretty strong reason and a bad experience for having that opinion.</p>

<p>This is where everyone jumps in and says not to care about her. She is only a distant relative of mine and I haven't even met her b4 coming here. But I still feel that I should have responsibility towards her. May be because I like to take responsibilities or may be because I got this affinity towards trouble, I went to her when she was with her BF one night. But then as I was approaching them I had this hesitation that she might feel bad. So I can't make up my mind and lingered around for a while. Then her BF came to me and started lecturing me about limits. God damn, He crossed his limits and tried to threaten me. I seriously doubt this guy. The way he feels, like he is prince charming and no girl could resist him.. Oh I seriously doubt where all this is leading.</p>

<p> Anyhow I called her up and said I want to talk to her. She said she will talk later. I knew she meens "I don't wanna talk to you.", and I was right. So I just mailed her everything I wanted to say to her and I feel a little better now. I still feel uneasy about how I can't do a thing about all this, but atleast I have the satisfaction that I did all I can.</p>

<p> The most interesting part of this mhole affair is that I guessed this would happen even before I met her. Last summer one of my cousines told that this girl is gonna come to my college. According to her descreption I thought something like this would happen. I even commented that I should keep away from her if she is good looking(though I don't think she is, It still eludes me How she could have so many followers). When I first met her, I said She is gonna end up hating me. I knew this is coming but I just didn't plan for so early. enough of my rantings. I don't think I can write more without getting these killing instincts.</p>
