</table>

<p>Nothing really new on the topic from previous post. Just a reiteration of the facts in a tabular manner and also wanted to tell you that till now I tended a bit towards Thoughtworks. Now, only if they would turn that package up a notch. :) </p>

<p><em>Update:</em> Got a call back for my mail as I was finishing this post. So I got a very little hike from that less-than-good package to an okay-okay-types package. I'm almost happy. How about you guys? Please do speak what you want to and leave comments. You guys who bother enough to take a look at my humble blog are really important to me.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> So I got a call from ThoughtWorks to remove the salary info from the blog. Yeah, I know its unusual, but I'm complying. May be because they asked my nicely ;). Hi HR(I didn't want to take your name; it's more sensitive than my salary.), if you are reading this, I would have appreciated a comment more than a call. :D</p>
