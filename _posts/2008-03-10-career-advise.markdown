<p>High paying, flexible, start-up with lots of work <em><strong>or</strong></em> regular hours, good paying, normal company with great work culture?</p>
<p><em>what would you pick?</em></p>
<p>Considering, on long term I want to start my own company,
<ul>
<li>if I take first, I get first hand startup experiance,</li>
<li>if I take second, I get to know how normal comapnies work, and get the time to work on my own ideas.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> Just to clarify, the first is really small company in Hyderabad with just five employees in all and the other is <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a>, B'lore.</p>
