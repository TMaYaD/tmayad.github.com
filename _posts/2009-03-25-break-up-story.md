Happens to everyone. When a lover actually blames the other, they are
looking for denial. When you say "if you don't love me, get lost"; you
are expecting to be beaten black and blue and asserted how much she
actually loves you. Girls express it with a few subtle differences but
its essentially same.

How ever what you receive instead is a broken heart at those harsh
words. While your emphasis was on 'if you don't love' part, she cringes
over 'get lost' part. Hurt and angry, story ends there.

Only if you actually love and understand the other person, Only when you
can stop thinking of what it sounded like to 'you', and how much it hurt
'you', when, instead, you think of what 'he' is expecting, What 'he' is
thinking, Only when you can actually share feelings and live like one
soul, one life;

Only then will you actually be happy understanding how much he loved
you, and still loves you. How much it hurt 'him' to be asking that. You
dont have to bear your sorrow silently; you simply won't feel sad.
Instead of being angry and breaking up, you could smile and take him
into your arms. Assert him, like he wanted, how much you love him in so
many kisses. He would then throw a pitiful look on his face, smile a
little and all would be well.
