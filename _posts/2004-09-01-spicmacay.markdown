<p align="justify">Today there was a cultural program performed by SPICMACAY in our college. I don't know what it means or what is the theme of the groupin general. But today they performed a dance on "Mahishasura Mardhanam". And the performance was excellent.</p>

<p align="justify">It was a story of how the goddess we consider as mother of the three supreme gods killed a devil called "Mahishasura".We celebrate the  day as "Vijaya Dasami" or "Dhussahra" (Don't bother trying to pronounce it right, Except with great luck, you can't get it right). This year it comes on oct 22(We follow the telugu lunar calender. So it changes every year.)</p>

<p align="justify">Did you understand what I'm saying? Well it could get kinda twisted with someone from a different background. I used to have anthropology classes a couple of sems back. Then I learned about etic and emic meanings. It seems that you always have different views of the same thing. When you try to understand aspects of a thing, you twist the meaning according to your background. Same is happeneing here I guess. So don't bother too much if you don't understand.</p>
