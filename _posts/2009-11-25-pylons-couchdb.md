I got sick of Schemas, migrations and versions of SQL. So I decided I
want an alternative. There is couchDB for one. I'm going to give it a
try. Watch this space for updates on my progress. Meanwhile, leave your
comments if you know of any alternatives.

PS: There is also node but I am yet to verify if it fits the purpose.
