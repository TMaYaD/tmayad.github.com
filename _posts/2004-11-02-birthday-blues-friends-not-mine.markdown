<p>Today is the birthday of a friend of mine. I was invited yesterday for the party at 12'o clock. When I was there, I remembered I'm not supposed to go empty handed. But what can I get at that time of the hour? So I plucked a flowr nearby and gave it to her.</p>

<p>Sounds rather stupid. doesn't it? That's how I am. Doing all sorts of stupid things.</p>
