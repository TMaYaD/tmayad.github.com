<p>Question -- What kind of a person takes what he likes and forces more changes he likes and ends up in pain and misery with something which he hates? A hypocrite who hates Hypocrisy. Thats more hypo critic, don't you think?</p>

<p>So everyone wondered what my name meant on Orkut. Shinigami-no-seishin, or the 'spirit of death god'; destroying everything the destroyer likes. An unavoidable trap. The very act of getting something is by destroying it.</p>

<p>Incoherent like ever? probably. The pain at accepting anything unattainable or the pain of seeing it destroyed when it was within grasp? Which one should I choose? No matter what I do, in the end it only means that I won't get what I wanted... right?</p>
<p>Fate? Destiny? What are they? If they rule the world, Why am I here? Who is the other god fighting me? questions or answers?</p>
