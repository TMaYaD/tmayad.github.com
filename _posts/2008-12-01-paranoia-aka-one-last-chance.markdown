Some thing scary is in the air.. like this is the end!
Death? No, That's not it.
Death is not frightening. More over, I know I'm not going to die tomorrow.
This is the result of my years of carelessness, laziness and procrastination.
My own doom that I brought upon, not only on me but also on those who believed in me.
This feels like the end of me.. end of Subhash.

Oh! What have I done?
What am I doing? What am I going to do?
I'm not sure. But I'm not going to...
Let go of my ideals or day dreams, like one might call them.
Step back and settle for mediocre.
Let the past weigh me down.
What I'm going to do is learn from that past.
 
This is the one last chance I got.
I know life isn't going to be easy on me like it had been before.
I know things aren't going to be the same.
But I will survive, and live another day to tell the tale.

Let this be my action plan.
I won't get complacent.
I won't go easy on myself.
I will never compromise.

There is a glimmer of hope in the air.
The fear still blinds me to everything
and still I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
It isn't getting any closer. Huh?

Oh! I get it.
I need to go towards it.

PS: I'll give my best at business. And I won't neglect my MBA aspiration.
PPS: I guess this is the end of the career options series! Errr, This 'HAS' to be the end of it.
