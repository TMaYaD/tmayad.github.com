<p>The day before yesterday I wanted to die. Yeah thats right! This post would not have  been posted.</p>

<p>So what happened? I was chating about it with some one and the more I talked of it, the more I was afraid of it. Finally my courage failed me. So Can I call it lucky? no, absolutely not.</p>

<p>This is what actually happened. THe night before, I had rather bad dreams, And I woke up with really bad head ache. I lay there in bed all day with it. By evening, My posn got worse and I had vomiting.  Felt like I was in hell. It was as if my head had turned into lead, I can't think anything. That coupled with my latest disappointments lead me to think that I should quit. But some where deep within my reason kicked into my mind the doubt weather It's really what I want or weather it is momentary desperation. So I thought I should see how long I could stand it. Thats how I ended up chatting about it.</p>

<p> It feels rather silly now. But I don't even want to dream about that day. I couldn't even talk about it to any one over here because I'm afraid if my dad gets to  know about this, he will be all upset and worried.</p>

<p>There is another angle for the whole thing. I can't stop thinking about this. Those who would have discouraged me then, would now say that I faked it for sympathy. Can't no one ever think simple and act simple? Why do people always screw up things with ridiculous ideas and customs? I can never understand</p>
