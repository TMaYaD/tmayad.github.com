<p>No more suspense fiction for me. Some how they fail to catch my attention. As I see it, one gets the pleasure in it by trying to get in the heads of the characters and keep guessing the murderer. How ever the process is different for me. Where ever I start, I work the thought all the way back to the author. Instead of the characters, I place my self in the boots of the author and try to think of the mystery. Of course that kills the whole fun in reading the thing in the first place. But some how I can't stop at the right point if I may say so to draw enough pleasure out of the thing.</p>

<p>One book I felt was so so was the da-vinci code. The book possibly owes that to the progressive style of unveiling the plot... like a treasure hunt (wait a minute... it 'IS' a treasure hunt ;) ) This book on the other hand was as monotonic that I could have read it backwards without much effect. C'mon the uber-careful wording in the first chapter itself is a dead give away. Now, don't get me wrong. like I said had I read it as a plain story, it is definitely nice touch. But knowing that it is a suspense, it is easy to see through the word selection. IMHO, a good suspense is really un-assuming. know what I mean? ;) </p>
