<p>Gone!!!</p>

<p>It's all up. Today I forgot to attend DIM tut at 11'o clock once again. This isn't the first time  and I doubt if it's going to be the last time. Now that means I dropped below the minimum attendance line and unfortunately, according to the seniors,the DIM prof., Mr. Naresh Jotwani is very tough and that makes the matter even worse.</p>
<p>I wonder weather I have a chance to re-exam or not. May be I have to takeup summer/winter course. May be I have to do it next year if there is one left for me. I think I will be kicked out of the college. Just look at my scores. They are sub 2. with all the subjects. Wonder what they are going to be if I'm can't take up one of the exams.</p>
<p> It's all over.. Dead end Dead ahead</p>
