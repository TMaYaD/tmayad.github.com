<p>Yeppie!! I got a new bike. Bought Hero Honda Ambition 133. Yeah, I know there is a new 135 in the market. Thats why I got the bike onto road(Including trivial expances like tips to the boy and stuff) at a price of Rs.45,750. a whole 6k less.</p>

<p>Dad says I can't take it to hyderabad or college. I'll worry about that later. I'm planning to take it t hyd next summer when I do my internship and GRE coaching. Then may be dad will get confidence and let me take it to college too. who knows?</p>

<p>If you are still wondering about what happened to all my nasty mood a couple of weeks ealier, I had snapped out of it quite a little while back. Some one who really matters told the magic words. I don't know weather they really means it or not, but they did say it, even if accidentally or if its a slip off. Now I'm happy.(not so much ofcourse).</p>
