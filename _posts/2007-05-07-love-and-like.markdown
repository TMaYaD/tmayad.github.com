<p>When it all started, never thought it would end this way. Was always a thing of joy. Always feel happy when around. Liked. Wanted to have it all. Asked, if hates. Asked if its okay to be with. Thought its fine as long as doesn't hate.</p>
<p>Now its different. Liked even more. Started loving. Unlike earlier, feelings mattered. The fact that doesn't like started to hurt. The realization that doesn't even mind breaking up did it.</p>
<p>Broke up.</p>
