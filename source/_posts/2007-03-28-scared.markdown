<p>Yeah, I've been away for quite some time and quite a lot of things were happening in my life. There is this girl I liked and I proposed and she accepted me as well. We were going out and I believe she likes me. But there is still a lingering doubt how any one can like someone like me. And weather she really likes me or thinks I'm an okay sort of guy.</p>

<p>Its been four months or so and we've got pretty close. But still I feel there is a veil between us. May be my idea of privacy is different from her idea of privacy but I don't wish to hide anything from her, while I expect the same. If we are to share our lives in future, I believe we need to understand each other, but she is still an enigma to me. She is smart, yet naive; caring, constantly scolding; loving, hiding; talkative, secretive!! I don't expect anyone to like me. But I'm glad she does. And doubt if she really does. Afraid she might not. Hope she does.</p>

<p>I know where this is heading. I don't wanna go there but can't steer away. Well, let time decide where I might end up.</p>
