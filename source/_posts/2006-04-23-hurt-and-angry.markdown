<p>I'm hurt because no one wants to talk to me.<br />
No one talks to me because they don't like to.<br />
They don't like to because they think I'm an idiot.<br />
"Here I am brain the size of a small galaxy and no one even wants to talk to me."</p>

<p>I'm angry because I can't share my joy.<br />
I can't share my joy because I never knew how to.<br />
I never learnt to share because I always felt alone.<br />
"Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only companions."</p>
