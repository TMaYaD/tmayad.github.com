This is something I am being asked by quite a few people about. No wonder they do, after all, I did get a good score. Not to be modest or anything, but I'm hardly the kind of the guy you should be asking.

Lesson 1
---------

*"I  should start preparing."*

That's what I kept saying to my self for about two and a half months after I left my previous job and decided to pursue GMAT as alternate career plans. One night I had the wake up call and took a stock of my career so far and unable to find any thing fine till then, **decided** I have to do it some how. Not any score, but 760-99 %ile

Well there you go. That's the first important part. To decide that you *have to do it*. Then get out of the lazy-chair and start doing something. It doesn't matter which books you read, what test you take, how much time you study per day. It has to start, and with a conviction.

Lesson 2
---------

*"I got job to attend and chores to do. Don't find sufficient time to study."*

To be frank even after I started preparing,  I used to fall asleep before I completed a couple of pages. For a long time I was reading may be 2-3 pages a day and no more. That and I used to do one *problem solving session* each day.

A little about my **practice sessions**. I used to time them for **75 minutes** each. Length of one GMAT section. Short enough to keep reminding me *"one hour, and this session would be over, 45 min and seesion will be over, so on"* so that i won't fall asleep in between. And I used to do **50 problems** in a session. A little over the number of questions in either of GMAT sections. Remember: You can have a couple of minutes left at the end of the exam but not even a single question.

More over, when I give the test, as I am aiming for a high score, after the first 8-10 questions, I would be in the top bin. If I am to work on those questions, I shouldn't take as much time on average questions.

The bottom line is it apparently worked for me. You might adopt it with a few modifications or you might come up with your own different strategy. I should refer back to our first lesson here, and I can't stress this enough. The **conviction** is  what should be driving you.

More Questions
---------------

*"I have more questions."*

Well.. abstractly, probably that's all the *"gyan"* I could give you. :) If you have any specific concerns or questions, I could tell you; I'm not going anywhere. Leave your questions in the comments section.

There is also another post coming up with summary of what I've learned from the GMAT books. Stay tuned...
