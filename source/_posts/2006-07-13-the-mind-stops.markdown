<pre>The circle continues
of death and the life.

It appears so still
But its a circle that never stops

I stand very near the death
Everywhere round me is the life

Where the light meets the shadows
I came back for you.</pre>

<p>I know it sounds too obscure because it hides things I wanna share but can't. I know it sounds stupid because I'm no poet. Yet I'm sure they like it for just those reasons.</p>
