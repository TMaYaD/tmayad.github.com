<p> Yeah, this became most irritating when they want me to build a database app in C or java. Now that's an easy thing. After all everyone else already completed it. So whats the problem unless if I'm a dunder head?</p>

<p> Well, here is the catch! If I'm to make searches and d-base operations efficient, I'm supposed to use data structures which recide in RAM, which is volatile. So I'm supposed to use files to save the data. But then the file access is going to become one hell of a bottle neck to the whole program. I mean, I have to load the entire file contents into RAM. That's a sickening job. Okay!! I can use files them selves as nodes of data structures,i.e, use one file for each record and instead of further pointers in record, I can use filenames. But that's gonna make use of file system, which is not mine and in no way am I gonna let it be included in my code efficiency, esp. when the prof. insisted on importance of DBMS over File System. I'm not gonna <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2004/12/nostolgia.html">go against</a> him or his word.Yeah, I can create a dummy file and use raw access to create a virtual non-volatile memory space and build my data structures there. But I'm not allowed to do so because, "That's out of the scope of the course". Enough of this faking studies. I give up.</p>
