<p>Today the winds are strong and little short of depicting a brewing storm. What is it going to be? Just a passing thing or is it going to lash out strongly across my face? I don’t know how this is going to turn out. But I’m definitely looking forward for the calmness after the storm. Is it to come or is it just another dreamy wish of me? How do I know what is the right thing to do when I can’t even think clearly and blank out every once in a while.</p>

<p>No it isn’t the peace. Its still the dreaded cold. I’m still as lost as ever and I don’t seem to be making any progress. Is this the end of it all? Today finally even I went so far as to ask not to talk to me. To be true, I’m loosing trust I had in myself. My little world is coming apart and I can’t do anything about it save sit & watch or let go off of it all.</p>

<p>Now that we have come this far, let me try to describe myself. I’m a cry baby. I try to make people guilty and get things done on  their empathy. I’m vile and cunning; always plotting and manipulating. No matter how noble a name I give it, deep inside I know that I lie, I cheat, and get things done through scheming and holding others scapegoats. So why should she like me? I never did anything for her. What ever I did, I did it for the impression and not truly for her. The one thing I could do for her, as she asks it, to leave her alone, I couldn’t do it! So what’s the meaning of all the “I love you” s?</p>

<p>So that means I love no one else besides me. What about pinky? She used to love me so much. I ignored her and cried foul when she did that. I hurt others and don’t want them to hurt me back. She still loves me and can’t forgive me for what I’ve done. Some times, you can’t simply plug a hole you’ve poked.  And that is really the reason she hurts me. But still I tell my self that she hurts just because she found another. If it’s one person who hated me, It’s their problem. I could possibly forget and move on. But if everyone hates me, then it’s my problem. I need to do something and I don’t. Instead I just withdraw into myself. When I do that even if there is somebody who comes near me. They will move away. Who wants to be friends with someone who always talks about himself, rants to be more precise, I might have a chance if I’m more cheerful. But Marvin seems to be more cheerful than me.</p>

<p>Let me try….
I will talk less from now on, and listen more.
My phone bill must go down. K
I’ll save more and earn a little and spend less.
I’ll always keep a smile on my face. J
I won’t expect anything, or I will expect like always, but try not to be bogged by the failures.
I will leave Swetha as alone as I can ;) .
I will apologize to Pinky truly and won’t show any excuses.
I will read more and try fewer jokes :P</p>

<p>May be someday after I stop making outgoing calls, may be I’ll receive a few incoming calls.
May be after I stop spending I’ll get a few gifts.
May be my smile will fill joy around me.
May be after I stop being the crybaby, Swetha will give me the kiss.
May be Pinky will stop trying to hurt me.
May be… Just may be…</p>
