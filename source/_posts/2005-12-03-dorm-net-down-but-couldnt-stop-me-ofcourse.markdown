<p>Today my dorm net is down. I was planning to get my gprs activated anyway for use over the holidays in coming month and I got it activated today. I was back online again after a little fiddling with the settings. The guys at airtel customer care are obsolutely useless in this regard. I wish airtel gives them a little technical training than training them to say their names so fast that you would wonder for alf a minute what they just said.</p>
<p> The joy didn't last long though. The signal in the room is pretty bad and the speeds are worse. I tried hosting the phone in the window, and it actualy worked, though not really good enough. I finally let go of the pc and came down to food court and was chatting on the phone(6600 is really handy). I wasn't satisfied yet and got fed up with the tiny screen. I finally borrowed a friend's laptop and here I am composing this piece of blog. Oh yeah, I'm online on IM too [:P] </p>
