<p align="justify">I always dream of flying an rc helicopter. I decided to build my own and headed for the web. I got a couple of web sites <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/blues/heli_project" target="_new">heli project</a> and another <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Baja/Desert/2160/index21.html" target="_new">Indian site </a>.</p>

<p align="justify">However I just realised that I require anywhere above 15 grand to get one I presently settled for this <a href="http://n.ethz.ch/student/mmoeller/fms/index_e.html" target="_new">simulater</a>. But I made up my mind to fly real one someday, better say sooner than later.</p>
