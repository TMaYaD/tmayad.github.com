<p><strong>YAY, it's finally here. The Nokia 7710 rocks.</strong></p>
<p>I already had gprs and up went the browser as soon as I got it. (actually I made my first call to my sister and my first sms to  my best friend) The first site I hit was gmail. It's a real browser test. as expected, it had fallen back to basic html view. The javascript support in the inbuilt browser is not to the mark. Also it supports iframes but is buggy, I had to disable frames support to login. other wise it simply refuses to go any further.</p>
<p>next thing I did was download agile messenger and connect to yahoo and gtalk. Here again there is a glitch. If you connect to both the services you can't use the off line messaging.....</p>
