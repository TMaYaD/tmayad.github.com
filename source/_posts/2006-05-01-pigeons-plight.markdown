<p> There is a Pigeon in our hostel corridor that's been roaming around all day today. We have pretty many pigeons and they roam around all the time. But what's worrying though is that the pigeon doesn't fly. I wonder what's wrong with it. I'm worried what it might do without flyig and thus food. I don't even know what I can feed it with. </p>
<p> I thought of taking it to vet tomorrow, but I don't know where I can find one in this desert of a city and if he can take care of a pigeon. In fact I must confess that I'm a little afraid to go near it, may be it is infected with some sort of avian influenza or what ever. I never heard of pigeons catching it but still...... </p>

<p> I just can't sit in my room and worry about exams like others or play Dota and prophesise that its gonna die for sure. I don't know what I can do but I wanna do something. I tried pigeon lovers community and leaving scraps with the members but I don't know about the response. I wish the pigeon just flies back home by morning. </p>

<p> Now that I think of it, how is it gonna spend the night? With all of us insomniacs infesting the night can it find it secure enough to sleep in the hostel corridor? I should go and find a place for it, may be on the terrace. </p>

<p> I gave it a few grains of rice and water but it wouldn't touch. It's shivering. So I left there hoping that it will eat and drink after some time. When I went there the next morning, the pigeon is no longer there. I hope it flew home. (and Harita says its relatives must be taking care of it now :) ). I don't know weather it had the rice or water because the cleaning crew cleared up before I even woke up. </p>
