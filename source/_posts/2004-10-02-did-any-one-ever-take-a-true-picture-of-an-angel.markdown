<p>Enough of laughing. He seriously reminds me of my own attempts at getting a few pics of my angel. Despite my sincerest efforts the fact still remains that I never had a decent pic of her. Or may be no photogroaph ever taken can depict her angelic self. They are just never the same as her presence.
Oh boy, when I see her I go dumb. I comletely loose my self. Dumb as I am, I used to think I couldn't get any dumber, till I met her that is. She truely takes my breath away and make me gasp.</p>
