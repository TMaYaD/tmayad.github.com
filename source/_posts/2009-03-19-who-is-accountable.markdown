`What Nonsense!`_

  It is outrageous that people would invoke their personal sense of morality when dealing with essentially criminal issues. The girl may have agreed to striptease for her bf and  allowed him to film it but it certainly does not follow that she had given him the right to publicly release those videos. The girl’s act was stupid and naive; her bf’s act was despicable and criminal. There is a difference.

  What if a person released their spouse’s video shot while they were engaged in certain private acts? Would it be remarkably different from this case? Would it be then be justified to rant against increasing ”obsecenity” in the society?

  Womyn are stupid.

My take? They are all at fault. Why does one have to be good while another is bad. They all are very bad people. There is a saying,

 *Manchollu cheddollu antu vere undaru.*
 *Avasaram koddhi manchullu kuda cheddulluga marocchu;*
 *Avakasam leka cheddollu kuda manchalluga migilipovacchu.*

 No one is particularly good or bad.
 Need can turn good men into bad;
 Bad people might remain good due to lack of opportunity.

The girl, alleged victim, should have thought of the consequences before stripping(consequence of not marrying) or letting her boyfriend record it (possibility of getting out). The guy should have looked at his own worthiness when the girl refused or what a useless chump he looks if he resorted to sending the messages. Hacking? hacking my foot. It's as simple as she gave him her password as part of romantic trust. She asked for it. The guy again is a useless chump ofcourse.

And what's the criminal bull shit. The law and courts to me are another bunch of big bullies making rules about what they think is right. So pardon me if I don't see why you particularly point out the guy as criminal. Now we come to the guys parents. Why does any body presume anything about them. If they support him they are wrong. If they punish him, they are right. Its the same if the guy is a 5 yr old who stole a pencil from his playmate. As a parent they are supposed to set him right. Atleast try to set him right. And the girl's parents. Oh! Stop trying to be 'supportive'. She doesn't deserve it. She isn't a 4 year old being bullied into giving up her ice-cream. Either she should have not done it if she had problem with it or she doesn't care in which case you shouldn't be worrying.

The media... Ah yes! That's an interesting thing. I never understand what it is that it wants. In all honesty I like gossip and glamor magazines better, or even play boy. Atleast they are not pretentious of what they are. I don't think I need to expand any more on that. Accept it guys, you are trying to 'sell' stories. Not educate or inspire anybody. And you guys reading it, take anything you read with a healthy dose of salt. 

PS: Telugu daily war Sakshi Vs Eenadu is entirely different kind of 'selling'
