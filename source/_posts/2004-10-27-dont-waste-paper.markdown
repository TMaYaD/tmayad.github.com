<p>My exams ended with a Bang today and a shock(for the prof). For my last exam,I returned the empty answer script to invigilator as soon as I got the question paper without even the name on it claiming it is a waste of paper and can be used for another exam instead. He was shocked and called for the subject prof. The prof  had to call me back and pursuade me into writing something. He said, "Don't give up so easily my friend,".</p>

<p>Now I don't even know what are S,T,x,x*,X,X* in fourier series. What am I supposed to write? I had a little input data on the question sheet and I don't know how to process it. So I did everything I can do with the data nomatter what the subject or the syllabus is and filled the answer script with all sorts of crap. Now that's what I call a waste of paper and resources.</p>
