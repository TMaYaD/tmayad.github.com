<p>I got down the bus in hyderabad at six in the morning. The climate was a pleasent one with sun blotted by the clouds. Looking around I felt the familiar surroundings. I felt like I was coming home. with the back pack and the laptop bag, I started walking.</p>
<p>Some thing is different. I can feel it. Its not the same as always. I felt like something is not quite right. It dawned slowly upon me. The place is still my home, a second home that is; But I'm not supposed to be here anymore. I'm an alian here.</p>
