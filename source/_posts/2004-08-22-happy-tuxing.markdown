I installed and tweaked <a href="http://www.pcquest.com" target="_new">PCQ Linux 2004</a> last night with <a href="http://wmi.berlios.de/" target="_new">wmi</a> as window manager. Tried <a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_new">winamp</a> on <a href="http://www.winehq.com" target="_new">wine</a> although without much success.

What I need now is w3m & zgv. But they are acting up. got to fix that thing.
