<p>Hi every one,<br />
Finally the day I dreaded was here. I've lost everything just like that. Even the tears deserted me. They didn't find a place when my own heart disavowed me.</p>

<p> This blog has always been a place to hold my feelings and desires. It's been so inactive lately because what I felt was mostly apathy. Now I don't have any feeling left in me except a sharp pain stabbing me in the void that should have been my heart. good bye all</p>

<p>p.s: My technical blogs <a href="http://sub-cache.blogspot.com">sub-cache</a> and <a href="http://timeless-scripts.blogspot.com/">timeless-scripts</a> will (hopefully) still be alive.</p>
