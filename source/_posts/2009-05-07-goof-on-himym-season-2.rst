I have submitted this goof to IMDB.

  Title: "How I Met Your Mother" (2005) {Bachelor Party (#2.19)}

  Type: Plot holes

  Goof: In the scene where Barney goes to meet lily who is still in SF, around 20min mark, he buys a ticket for her and says "I can't keep stealing chicks from Marshall". In the 2nd episode of the season where he does the referred stealing, he does so 'after' Marshall "checks out robin's ass" and that's when lily is back in NY.
