<p>He kept staring at the lonely rose, pink like her lips, more beautiful than ever, and even more lovely as it sways in the breeze. It seems to be asking for her.<p>

<p>This was inspired by <a href="http://nrambles.blogspot.com">n</a>'s 55. Though I didn't understand the significance of 55 words, I wanted to try something similar. And I ended up with this 160(as in 160 characters). i picked it up because its the capacity of a single SMS. Trying to capture my imagination in 160 characters, not 1 more, not 1 less :)</p>
