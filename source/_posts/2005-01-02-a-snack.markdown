<p> Have you ever heard of somebody waking up at 4:20 in the morning, brush the teath, fix an omlette, eat it and then again fall back to sleep?</p>

<p> I mean how many of us wake up to have a midnight snack(though the time is early in the morning..). If one wakes up for water finding himself thirsty, it is quite understandable and common place.But this...oh boy.</p>

<p> Sometimes I'm surprisingly crazy, even to my self! If you haven't understood the seviarity of the comic situation, let me tell you that I'm the kind of guy who stays in bed after awakening for half an hour minimum, not understanding what is what. Then brushing, cooking and eating on pure instinct? this is the most unnatural thing I've done in last few years when I became more of a machine.</p>
