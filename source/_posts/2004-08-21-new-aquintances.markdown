<p>We had freshers today. I did a little work and showed off a lot.</p>

<p>I dared enough to approach Shruthi(my newly discovered cousin). What more, I even talked to her friends. It doesn't seem so tough afterall. But I can't believe it's so easy as I was loosing my relations somewhere else. Where I need the most.</p>

<p>Like I read in Shivkhera's "You can win", I'm manipulative, arrogant(which, it seems, I misunderstand as self esteem), greedy( It's like sea water, You grow thirsty as you drink more)a nd much more. But I don't realize it till I act up and it's all over. Not to push away the blame but I need to change.</p>
