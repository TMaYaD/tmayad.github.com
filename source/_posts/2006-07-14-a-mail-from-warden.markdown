I personally don't think this is your mail sir. In case you haven't got
the picture yet, here is how I look at it.

The line saying not to reply is dead giveaway. Some one wants you to get
pissed off fending off unwanted visitors. And if you send of a mail about
themail not being from you without much explanation about how it is
done(as you generally do) you would end up looking like a fool who
contradicts himself or who can't guard his mail account, esp. after that
nicely crafted mail.

If people see group ids, they tend to believe it's from you as us lesser
mortals don't have access to them. And that was achieved, I think, by
putting those in to field, which would obviously bounce, and the long list
of [studentid]@daiict.ac.in style maild addresses in bcc to actually
deliver the mail.

If I may, I would suggest you to send another mail explaining this and
declaring a fine on everyone in the college including the sys admins for
failing to notice this unless the real culprit is found. Would be so much
like you and you'll have your reputation secure, precisely the content and
IMHO reason behind the mail.

PS:
moral of the story(1) Your way of fining for every damn stupid thing is
really irritating and unlike the one who made that spoof, this sircasm
filled mail is my style of taking the frustration out on you. I was taught
from childhood about being bold and stright forward. even if you are tobe
angry about it and punish me I won't ever regret this.

moral of the story(2) blocking SMTP and IMAP/POP3 access can not stop
anyone. on the otherhand if I had POP3 access, its a piece of cake to fish
out such spoofs with mailman and fetchmail(sry, your outlook/outlook
express, if youlike other profs use it, is useless tomy best knowledge in
this regard and I would like to bash up windows in praise of linux at the
slightest oppurtunity) So for gods sake realise your internet/intranet
policies are way out of date and off the mark.
