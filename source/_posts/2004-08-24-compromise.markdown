<em>To hell with DP</em>

<p>Once more I did a terrible mistake. I compromised once and in a wrong place.Now every one expects me to compromise again and again. What ever group I choose, Who ever I associate with, I'm always subjugated. I'm always treated as if I'm born to obay. I have to show the world I can rule.... and better too.</p>

<p>It's not so simple either.When someone compromised for me, I will (not necessarily in return) compromise for him. But why should I compromise with someone else I don't give a damn about. For someone who doesn't care so much as to thank me and more over makes fun of me inspite of the help I've done just to please his ego, why should I compromise? Even if the request was made by someone I consider well worth my resources, Why should I compromise?</p>

<p>I suggested the same timing for meeting as Sandeep was asking now. But then I faced only rejection. Very painstakingly I rescheduled my day according to others time slot. Now why should I drop my appointments on a last minutes notice? Why should I even consider it? When my voice is not worth hearing, why should I care of other's Idiocity?</p>

<strong><em>WHY?</em></strong>
