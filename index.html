I got sick of Schemas, migrations and versions of SQL. So I decided I want an alternative. There is couchDB for one. I&#8217;m going to give it a try. Watch this space for updates on my progress. Meanwhile, leave your comments if you know of any alternatives.

PS: There is also node but I am yet to verify if it fits the purpose.

A few days back my slice started giving me warnings about heavy swap usage and my websites started crawling dead slow despite very low traffic. top_ gave me the answer I needed. Apache_ is eating away a lot of memory without doing anything. I&#8217;ve been hearing a good deal about nginx_ and wanted to give it a try.

Recently I&#8217;ve been working on a rails project and needed to deploy it. Looking at rails guides pointed me to passenger_ for nginx. How ever the nginx ebuild for portage doesn&#8217;t support passenger. Some one has raised a `bug#266446`_ and created a patch for adding *passenger* use flag to nginx. There is one small catch though, it raises a sandbox violation error. Besides it needs passenger to be installed using ruby gem. A quick scan at the end of the build log showed the error. nginx is trying to prepare passenger through some rake task and causing the error.

I decided to write an ebuild for passenger and prepare it for nginx. A quick google search and looking at a couple of other ebuilds threw up a standard ebuild template for gem installations. A simple rake task later I got my passenger-2.2.5.ebuild_ and a `patch for nginx ebuild`_ to go with it.

They are up on Gentoo bugzilla, grab them and place them in your overlay.

I want bread crumbs for my site. I want DRY code. Bread crumbs are invariably derived from the site navigation tree. So I want one to be derived from the other or both be derived from the same source. After a little help from [mattmatt_] I came up with this one:

.. _mattmatt: http://github.com/mattmatt/crumble

- I want to define my site structure some where.

.. code-block:: python

    site = {
        home:{name:&#8217;Home&#8217;, controller:&#8217;home&#8217;, action:&#8217;index&#8217;},
        services:{name:&#8217;Services&#8217;, controller:&#8217;home&#8217;, action:&#8217;services&#8217;,
            pages:{
                oneservice:{name:&#8217;Service One&#8217;, controller:&#8217;home&#8217;, action:&#8217;serviceone&#8217;},
                anotherservice:{name:&#8217;Service Two&#8217;, controller:&#8217;home&#8217;, action:&#8217;anotherservice&#8217;},
            },
        products:{name:&#8217;Products&#8217;, restController:products},
        help:{name:&#8217;Help&#8217;, url:&#8217;/help.html&#8217;},
    }
                  
- All the nav menus will be generated as unordered lists. I should be able to call it as

.. code-block:: python

    nav(site)                                         #create top level site nav menu
    nav(site[&#8216;services&#8217;])                        # create nav menu for the services section of the site
    nav(&#8216;services&#8217;)                                #complicated: will have to search for the services in the site tree, at any depth
    #nav(url, name, action, controller, etc)    #use named parameters to construct url and look for the page with the url in the site tree

- And bread crumbs will be generated again as unordered lists, using 

.. code-block:: python

    crumbs()                                         #generate bread crumbs trail using current target url
    #all other calls of nav except for crumbs(site) which would be dumb anyway.

I have created a paster command for upgrade. Though it works fine for me for now, some bits might need updating to &#8216;proper&#8217; way.


**{project}/migrations/upgrade.py**

.. code-block:: python

    from paste.script.command import Command
    
    class Upgrade(Command):
        max_args = 1
        min_args = 0

        usage = &#8220;[Config]&#8221;
        summary = &#8220;Upgrades the database using sqlalchemy migrations&#8221;
        group_name = &#8220;SQLAlchemy Migrations&#8221;

        parser = Command.standard_parser(verbose=True)
        parser.add_option(&#8220;-V&#8221;, &#8220;&#8211;version&#8221;,
                          action=&#8217;store&#8217;,

                          help=&#8221;will upgrade to given version instead of latest&#8221;)

        def command(self):
            if len(self.args) == 1:
                conf_path = self.args[0]
            else:
                conf_path = &#8216;development.ini&#8217;

            from paste.deploy import appconfig
            from migrate.versioning.api import upgrade
            from os.path import dirname, abspath
            from pylons import config

            config = appconfig(&#8216;config:&#8217;+abspath(conf_path))
            url = config[&#8216;sqlalchemy.url&#8217;]
            #TODO: get app name or the app root path
            #repository = config[&#8216;here&#8217;] + &#8216;/{project}&#8217; + &#8216;/migrations&#8217;
            from {project} import migrations

            repository = migrations.__path__[0]

            upgrade(url=url, repository=repository, version=self.options.version)

entrypoint need to be added for the command

**setup.py**

.. code-block:: python

    entry_points=&#8221;&#8220;&#8221;
    [paste.app_factory]
    main = pharmaretail.config.middleware:make_app

    [paste.app_install]
    main = pylons.util:PylonsInstaller

    [paste.paster_command]
    upgrade = pharmamfg.migrations.upgrade:Upgrade
    &#8220;&#8221;&#8220;,


Also I changed my websetup to create versioned db

**{project}/websetup.py**

.. code-block:: python

    def setup_app(command, conf, vars):
        &#8220;&#8221;&#8220;Place any commands to setup pharmaretail here&#8221;&#8220;&#8221;
        load_environment(conf.global_conf, conf.local_conf)

        # Create the tables if they don&#8217;t already exist
        try:
            ControlledSchema.create(elixir.engine,&#8217;pharmamfg/migrations/&#8217;)
        except DatabaseAlreadyControlledError:
            print &#8220;Database already under version control&#8221;

This is something I am being asked by quite a few people about. No wonder they do, after all, I did get a good score. Not to be modest or anything, but I&#8217;m hardly the kind of the guy you should be asking.

Lesson 1
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

*&#8221;I  should start preparing.&#8221;*

That&#8217;s what I kept saying to my self for about two and a half months after I left my previous job and decided to pursue GMAT as alternate career plans. One night I had the wake up call and took a stock of my career so far and unable to find any thing fine till then, **decided** I have to do it some how. Not any score, but 760-99 %ile

Well there you go. That&#8217;s the first important part. To decide that you *have to do it*. Then get out of the lazy-chair and start doing something. It doesn&#8217;t matter which books you read, what test you take, how much time you study per day. It has to start, and with a conviction.

Lesson 2
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

*&#8221;I got job to attend and chores to do. Don&#8217;t find sufficient time to study.&#8221;*

To be frank even after I started preparing,  I used to fall asleep before I completed a couple of pages. For a long time I was reading may be 2-3 pages a day and no more. That and I used to do one *problem solving session* each day.

A little about my **practice sessions**. I used to time them for **75 minutes** each. Length of one GMAT section. Short enough to keep reminding me *&#8221;one hour, and this session would be over, 45 min and seesion will be over, so on&#8221;* so that i won&#8217;t fall asleep in between. And I used to do **50 problems** in a session. A little over the number of questions in either of GMAT sections. Remember: You can have a couple of minutes left at the end of the exam but not even a single question.

More over, when I give the test, as I am aiming for a high score, after the first 8-10 questions, I would be in the top bin. If I am to work on those questions, I shouldn&#8217;t take as much time on average questions.

The bottom line is it apparently worked for me. You might adopt it with a few modifications or you might come up with your own different strategy. I should refer back to our first lesson here, and I can&#8217;t stress this enough. The **conviction** is  what should be driving you.

More Questions
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;

*&#8221;I have more questions.&#8221;*

Well.. abstractly, probably that&#8217;s all the *&#8221;gyan&#8221;* I could give you. :) If you have any specific concerns or questions, I could tell you; I&#8217;m not going anywhere. Leave your questions in the comments section.

There is also another post coming up with summary of what I&#8217;ve learned from the GMAT books. Stay tuned&#8230;

`&#8221;In Love !&#8221;`_

    It all comes to a head when he is out gulping patiala pegs of Jack Daniels one after the other and in an inexplicable moment of madness calls Shriya up and says “ If you don’t like being with me, let it be . I want to end it here. It’s all over” and hangs up. Shriya, red in anger, for she loved him , more than anything else , rings him back and yells “ If you felt like that, let me tell you one thing, I loved you more than anything else but now I realise you didn’t deserve one bit of it. Thank you for letting me know. Get lost!”

.. _`&#8221;In Love !&#8221;`: http://psrhere.blogspot.com/2009/03/in-love.html

Happens to everyone. When a lover actually blames the other, they are looking for denial. When you say &#8220;if you don&#8217;t love me, get lost&#8221;; you are expecting to be beaten black and blue and asserted how much she actually loves you. Girls express it with a few subtle differences but its essentially same.

How ever what you receive instead is a broken heart at those harsh words. While your emphasis was on &#8216;if you don&#8217;t love&#8217; part, she cringes over &#8216;get lost&#8217; part. Hurt and angry, story ends there.

Only if you actually love and understand the other person,
Only when you can stop thinking of what it sounded like to &#8216;you&#8217;, and how much it hurt &#8216;you&#8217;,
when, instead, you think of what &#8216;he&#8217; is expecting, What &#8216;he&#8217; is thinking,
Only when you can actually share feelings and live like one soul, one life;

Only then will you actually be happy understanding how much he loved you, and still loves you. How much it hurt &#8216;him&#8217; to be asking that. You dont have to bear your sorrow silently; you simply won&#8217;t feel sad. Instead of being angry and breaking up, you could smile and take him into your arms. Assert him, like he wanted, how much you love him in so many kisses. He would then throw a pitiful look on his face, smile a little and all would be well.
