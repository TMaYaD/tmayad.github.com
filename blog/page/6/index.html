  <div class="entry-content"><p>Knowledge is the answer to the question &#8216;why?&#8217;. Knowledge, as they say, is wealth. But what use is any wealth that can&#8217;t help us? That brings us to another question &#8211; &#8216;how?&#8217;. How do I do this? How do I do that? How does the chicken cross the road? How on earth am I going to write an essay on intelligence? ;) etc etc etc. Now answering those requires intelligence, esp. more so if you are pretending to answer that last bit.</p>




<p>&#8216;How?&#8217; So where does the answers come from? From our knowledge of course! We compile that knowledge with a little bit of creativity and get new &#8216;solutions&#8217; to the problems. Or&#8230; do we? The Zen says that there is nothing like a problem and the solution. Everything is the same. The object and subject is one and the same. Then what are these so called solutions? They are nothing but a perspective of the problem. And the intelligence is the way of looking at &#8216;knowledge&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The same old question, why?</p>


<p>Why do you not like me? Why do you like someone who talks sugar coated words when he has the need and toss aside when he realizes the uselessness. Why did you have to give the advantage to him over me, the advantage I gave you. Why did you pass it on to him, an unworthy swine? You wonder how I could say that about him? Try telling him that my opinion matters and I bet he would be this totally different person. I know that isn&#8217;t the case and thats why I am expendable.</p>




<p>&#8220;why do I always go back to him?&#8221;, you ask? because I&#8217;ve been humiliated. Why doesn&#8217;t it bother you a bit? Am I not your brother? Is the world I&#8217;ve been living in nothing but an illusion I&#8217;ve cast around myself? What is the meaning of all the times we&#8217;ve spent together? Are you simply being courteous to your guest which I mistook for affection? Guest I should be. You didn&#8217;t even come to my home.</p>




<p>Is the humiliating moment I was put through a reflection of your own wish to settle the score with me for all the embarrassment I have caused you? Why did I end up like this? While the other impressed you enough to get away with whatever he he did? Do I have to talk with two faces like him to win you over? What about everything I believed in? What about the honesty and integrity? I know, I&#8217;m not perfect. I lie
and I cheat. but never once did I make a promise I knew I couldn&#8217;t keep. And not even once did I go un-atoned for my failure to keep one.</p>




<p>Am I trying to picture myself in all the virtuous unanimity while making an ugly pig of the other? I don&#8217;t know. This is the picture I see, with my naked eye, putting myself at the center of my world instead of you as I always would. I&#8217;ve been humiliated and tossed aside by you and your &#8211;what ever&#8211;. I&#8217;m hurt and I wanna cry. I understand that in a situation like this I would hate anyone who put me in this
pain and angst. But strangely enough, I can&#8217;t get angry with you. I want to, that would make me hate you and make me feel better. Remember the old adage, &#8220;One can only hurt you if you let them.&#8221;? But somehow I can&#8217;t. The more I try, the only feeling I could nurture is a bitter disgust towards myself. Is this what love is? I don&#8217;t know. This is what I certainly mean when I say I love you. But may be tomorrow I&#8217;ll
meat someone else who will make me feel a different set of emotions which make me realize that is real love and not this. We are always moving and we always learn. Then again, It could be possible that this is real love and nothing else, I could never know. But till proved otherwise, this is what I believe in.</p>




<p>Tell you what, If it means to give up everything I ever believed in to be liked by you, I will say no thanks. Yes, there are times when I said and thought I should change for winning you over. But if it has to be leaving the lofty ideals pounded into my head since I was a kid, I would  let it pass. I would rather be myself and be hated rather than kill my personality and be liked. I don&#8217;t know how that sounds to
you, to be told that the one you believed who loved you more than anything else wouldn&#8217;t care to change a bit for your sake. If it hurts, I&#8217;m really sorry. But remember, I always told that I was never sure which one tops my priority list, weather you or me. And yes, even after all this, I&#8217;m still confused and uncertain about it. And if I can&#8217;t love myself, how could I love you? It would be laughable if I let go of myself and say I would hold you till the end. I love you,
truly.</p>




<p>Do you remember my dear,  earlier, when everyone complained about my driving and expressed concern regarding riding with me, I always used to say that I don&#8217;t have any concern for my life and am reckless about it, but I do understand the value of another&#8217;s life and would be responsible for it. I always believed that if I die, it is the end of everything. There wouldn&#8217;t be anything to regret about and &#8211;what the
heck&#8211; the very notion of regret, right or wrong wouldn&#8217;t have any sense.  I can&#8217;t say that now. I can&#8217;t throw away my life when ever I want. I think I told you this a few days back. I believe I should live on even if I have to endure the pain in it. I have to be at your side. I want to take you in my arms and hold you forever. And if you don&#8217;t realize it yet, you gave a purpose to my life. I always said, &#8220;There
is a purpose for every persons existence.&#8221;, didn&#8217;t I? Now don&#8217;t get me wrong. I believe while this isn&#8217;t the whole deal, this is a part of it. And you might or might not know, in my world, there is only a success or a failure. I don&#8217;t believe in part-work-done philosophy. If I fail in one, I fail in all. I can&#8217;t let go of you.</p>




<p>See, my &#8216;Why?&#8217; did give some answers. But they aren&#8217;t complete yet. They don&#8217;t speak for themselves. I want to look more into myself and find what I am really and what I&#8217;ve become. Thank you, my dear, for telling me to take time off to stop and think it over. Now at least I can give a direction to my thoughts and feelings. I would have asked you the same but I know what would be the answer. Ask yourself, is it true?</p>




<p>Good night sweetheart. with love,
subbu</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>By the time I came back from vacations, my corner room has taken a heavy deal of downpour and turned dampy. A lot of fungus took away my pillow and other stuff. My PC too was in a big trouble. Among many others my keyboard wasn&#8217;t working properly, and then stopped working all together. Then the mouse followed the suit. Then after a lot of procrastination I gave them for warrenty last week and now I got another set :). I don&#8217;t think it is new.. I haven&#8217;t read the Logitech policy on replacements but Timex and Seagate says explisitly that either my goods are repaired or they will be replaced with throroughly repaired and verified equipment that came for servicing just like mine.</p>




<p>There are a lot of things that kept me from blogging all these days. Some serious, some lazy. But I think I&#8217;m back. I&#8217;ll try to keep it as up to date as possible. And while we are at it I moved over to blogger beta along with many others. So there is going to be a little rework of the blog template and stuff. Also, I plan to update the old posts with tags slowly when I get time. And please do head to my profile and check out my other blogs as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre><em>
TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could 
To where it bent in the undergrowth;         5
 
Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps the better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same,         10
 
And both that morning equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black. 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 
I doubted if I should ever come back.         15
 
I shall be telling this with a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference.         20

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The much tauted wedding of the millennium is over last night. Now technically my latest crush is a married woman. What next?</p>




<p>This blog is cynical, right? So here goes the rants. First I wanted to look good at the wedding. So I went to a saloon and the barber trims my hair really short and like a mushroom on my head. I go for bath and the water tank runs dry after filling the bath tub. I search for clothes and realize I have none ironed and have to press them myself. I ask for car and it runs into trouble at the petrol bunk, and a friend is with me. Poor thing, I hate dragging her into such situation. I have to push the car to get started and get drenched in sweat only to realize I forgot my deo. Luckily nothing went wrong at the marriage and I must really rejoice for that.</p>


<p>And a final touch, Heard Indu came for the wedding but left shortly before we were there. Darn the damn car!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="http://www.howtobeahero.com/images/type/wizard.gif" alt="I'm a Wizard!"></p>

<p>There are many types of magic, but all require a sharp mind and a cool head.  There is no puzzle I can&#8217;t solve, no problem I can&#8217;t think my way out of.  When you feel confused or uncertain, you can always rely on me to untangle the knots and put everything back in order for you.</p>


<p><em>Hello, Wizard.</em></p>

<h4>Character Stats:</h4>


<ul>
<li>Rogue (9)</li>
<li>Warrior (14)</li>
<li>Wizard (17)</li>
<li>Paladin (10)</li>
</ul>




<h4>Your Profile:</h4>




<p>You&#8217;re intelligent, educated, and just a bit superior to everyone you know. If you&#8217;re still in school, you probably make A&#8217;s, if you&#8217;re not too bored to waste the effort. If you work, your annoying boss relies on you to solve the problems no one else can figure out. You&#8217;ve never met a puzzle you can&#8217;t solve. When it comes to leisure, you&#8217;d rather read, play a strategy game, or surf the &#8216;Net than run around getting sweaty. You&#8217;re a brainiac, and you&#8217;re not ashamed to admit it.</p>




<p>Above all, you&#8217;re a mastermind and a great thinker. You see the unknown as territory to be conquered, and the mysterious as something to be systematically unraveled. You don&#8217;t have time for fools; you only spend your time with people who can comprehend your obfuscatory convolutions. You enjoy amassing knowledge, both useful and trivial.</p>




<h4>Your Mission:</h4>




<p>You were put on this earth to enlighten people. They will listen to you, because they are impressed by your vocabulary, your erudition, and your ability to grasp concepts that invariably elude them. You are the one who has to figure things out, because let&#8217;s face it - you&#8217;re the only one smart enough.</p>




<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to Discover Something. Something small, or something big. Find an unknown insect in your own backyard. Discover a cure for sunburn. Develop a faster way to get the dishes done. Calculate the number of molecules in the Andromeda galaxy. Discover a comet. Discover SOMETHING.</p>




<p>And do make it a priority. The Famous Adventurer of Silmaria has a crystal ball trained on you, and will be noting your progress.</p>




<h4>A Warning:</h4>




<p><strong>Try to remember:</strong> you&#8217;re not infallible. If people around you are all nodding and smiling, it may just be because they don&#8217;t have the faintest idea what you&#8217;re talking about. Check your facts and admit the possibility that even you can make mistakes. Loosen up. Make friends with a Rogue and have him or her try to poke holes in your theories. Who knows; you might actually have fun.</p>




<p>On another note - making plans and formulating theories can be quite stimulating, but at some point, you are going to have to actually DO something. Employ a Warrior, if necessary, to put your brilliant schemes into action. Just be sure your instruction manual is written in very small words.</p>




<h4>What Next:</h4>




<p>Don&#8217;t know a Rogue or a Warrior? Maybe you do, but just don&#8217;t yet know how to properly classify them. To discover the heroic archetypes of all your colleagues, display the following on your web site to arouse their curiosity</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> As you can see, I tried to make my template more readable after recieving one too many comments about the contrast. But it&#8217;s no good I guess. I can&#8217;t find a color for text that goes well with the darkness of night and the moon too. Any suggestions are welcome!! In my infinite wisdom, ;) I recollect that girls seems to have expertise in color combination (Just look at all those matching centers in besent road). So any girl out there who could help me?</p>

I personally don't think this is your mail sir. In case you haven't got
the picture yet, here is how I look at it.

The line saying not to reply is dead giveaway. Some one wants you to get
pissed off fending off unwanted visitors. And if you send of a mail about
themail not being from you without much explanation about how it is
done(as you generally do) you would end up looking like a fool who
contradicts himself or who can't guard his mail account, esp. after that
nicely crafted mail.

If people see group ids, they tend to believe it's from you as us lesser
mortals don't have access to them. And that was achieved, I think, by
putting those in to field, which would obviously bounce, and the long list
of [studentid]@daiict.ac.in style maild addresses in bcc to actually
deliver the mail.

If I may, I would suggest you to send another mail explaining this and
declaring a fine on everyone in the college including the sys admins for
failing to notice this unless the real culprit is found. Would be so much
like you and you'll have your reputation secure, precisely the content and
IMHO reason behind the mail.

PS:
moral of the story(1) Your way of fining for every damn stupid thing is
really irritating and unlike the one who made that spoof, this sircasm
filled mail is my style of taking the frustration out on you. I was taught
from childhood about being bold and stright forward. even if you are tobe
angry about it and punish me I won't ever regret this.

moral of the story(2) blocking SMTP and IMAP/POP3 access can not stop
anyone. on the otherhand if I had POP3 access, its a piece of cake to fish
out such spoofs with mailman and fetchmail(sry, your outlook/outlook
express, if youlike other profs use it, is useless tomy best knowledge in
this regard and I would like to bash up windows in praise of linux at the
slightest oppurtunity) So for gods sake realise your internet/intranet
policies are way out of date and off the mark.
