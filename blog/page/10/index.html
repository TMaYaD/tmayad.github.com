  <div class="entry-content"><p> Yeah, this became most irritating when they want me to build a database app in C or java. Now that&#8217;s an easy thing. After all everyone else already completed it. So whats the problem unless if I&#8217;m a dunder head?</p>




<p> Well, here is the catch! If I&#8217;m to make searches and d-base operations efficient, I&#8217;m supposed to use data structures which recide in RAM, which is volatile. So I&#8217;m supposed to use files to save the data. But then the file access is going to become one hell of a bottle neck to the whole program. I mean, I have to load the entire file contents into RAM. That&#8217;s a sickening job. Okay!! I can use files them selves as nodes of data structures,i.e, use one file for each record and instead of further pointers in record, I can use filenames. But that&#8217;s gonna make use of file system, which is not mine and in no way am I gonna let it be included in my code efficiency, esp. when the prof. insisted on importance of DBMS over File System. I&#8217;m not gonna <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2004/12/nostolgia.html">go against</a> him or his word.Yeah, I can create a dummy file and use raw access to create a virtual non-volatile memory space and build my data structures there. But I&#8217;m not allowed to do so because, &#8220;That&#8217;s out of the scope of the course&#8221;. Enough of this faking studies. I give up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> Have you ever heard of somebody waking up at 4:20 in the morning, brush the teath, fix an omlette, eat it and then again fall back to sleep?</p>




<p> I mean how many of us wake up to have a midnight snack(though the time is early in the morning..). If one wakes up for water finding himself thirsty, it is quite understandable and common place.But this&#8230;oh boy.</p>




<p> Sometimes I&#8217;m surprisingly crazy, even to my self! If you haven&#8217;t understood the seviarity of the comic situation, let me tell you that I&#8217;m the kind of guy who stays in bed after awakening for half an hour minimum, not understanding what is what. Then brushing, cooking and eating on pure instinct? this is the most unnatural thing I&#8217;ve done in last few years when I became more of a machine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&#8217;t ever written a review of any book. I&#8217;m not much into reading for that matter. I hardly glance through my own god forsaken text books if I ever buy them. I seldom get/install a reader or unzip the e-books I ever download. But there are still a few novels I read, by the brilliance of fate. I&#8217;ve read the sherlock holmes, The harry potter, and lately started with The Fountain Head, after a friend referred to it.</p>




<p>The last one by Ayn Rand apparently prompted this post but one should realise that it contributes so little in this plea or cry whatever you would like te call it. Any how we will see about it later.</p>




<p> The first novel I ever read was The dead man&#8217;s doller, an e-book on digit/chip CD  It&#8217;s just a string of incidents and the authers imagination. There is nothing I see in that work to talk about.</p>




<p> But then comes The great Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I read through the three volumes of it and it would be pure injustice if I don&#8217;t mention How much I enjoyed that time. I should accept that the book merely allowed me to use it for the purpose I intended it for, to pass time.</p>




<p> What it really lacks is the originality of the work. Mind you, I&#8217;m not saying that it is copied or something. But the auther, &#8216;sir&#8217; Arthur Canon Doyle, hyped too much. Through out the entire three volumes it&#8217;s always the same monotony. It starts with seemingly innocent details. I had the feeling that the auther purposefully hides the details to demonstrate that we can&#8217;t understand the details as good as Mr.Holmes. Then Mr.Holmes, with all his (un)natural talent lables them grotesque and start after them. Then with his ingenious techniques finds great many details of the case. The auther, with all his brilliant literary talents, always avoids the actual techniques , if there are any, very successfully. It appears to me as a big hoax.</p>




<p><i>There has been a long gap on my blog. So I decided to put up this incomplete post. I&#8217;ll complete it the next time I find time.</i></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeppie!! I got a new bike. Bought Hero Honda Ambition 133. Yeah, I know there is a new 135 in the market. Thats why I got the bike onto road(Including trivial expances like tips to the boy and stuff) at a price of Rs.45,750. a whole 6k less.</p>




<p>Dad says I can&#8217;t take it to hyderabad or college. I&#8217;ll worry about that later. I&#8217;m planning to take it t hyd next summer when I do my internship and GRE coaching. Then may be dad will get confidence and let me take it to college too. who knows?</p>




<p>If you are still wondering about what happened to all my nasty mood a couple of weeks ealier, I had snapped out of it quite a little while back. Some one who really matters told the magic words. I don&#8217;t know weather they really means it or not, but they did say it, even if accidentally or if its a slip off. Now I&#8217;m happy.(not so much ofcourse).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, I was just flipping my favourite blogs and a <a href="http://kousik.blogspot.com/2004/11/some-rare-moth.html">moth</a> there reminded me of my school days. </p>




<p>Once our biolagy teacher was teaching us about insect kingdom(or something else, I don&#8217;t remember.) and told us that moths would rest with their wings open but Butterflies with them closed. However it contradicted with my imaginationn of butter flies with their wings open and colourful, beautifully resting on the petals of flower.  I was too egoistic to believe that my dreams aren&#8217;t anywhere near truth. So I wanted to prove it otherwise. I flipped through the books and found our physics text with a pic of butterfly with wings open. It was used there to illustrate properties of light. I pulled it out in the next class and tried to prove that our teacher is wrong. But, she would refuse to listen saying it was a <i>Physics</i> text and she doesn&#8217;t care about what it says or shows. So I got so frustrated that I threw the book on the bench and shouted, &#8220;If you aren&#8217;t gonna listen to me, neither am I.&#8221; Saying so I walked out of the class and went to library.</p>




<p>I was arrogant, but I had my point right? More over I always used to be the topper and she wouldn&#8217;t do anything to me. My school is a good one where teacher can&#8217;t lay a finger on a kid. It&#8217;s nomore the same. I&#8217;m one of the lowest rankers in the college and good for nothing. If I do anything so much as taking stand against a prof, I&#8217;m done for.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lately there seems to be nothing but frustration here. But all that put together is nothing much to me because I don&#8217;t care about any of that crap. It&#8217;s just that I feel like writing all those grievances and rantings of mine and what would be a better place than blog!</p>




<p>Lately i found myself underperforming in the exams. That&#8217;s nothing to fret about because Its out of my own choice to explore a world I like. But I just discovered there is worse to come.</p>




<p>How do you feel when trust is broken? Awful!!? I don&#8217;t know clearly what I&#8217;m feeling right now. I&#8217;m in no position to think. I wonder how I&#8217;m writing this long when I can&#8217;t even string two words together. Even my hands refuse to type in. I can&#8217;t feel the music blowing the roof off. The coach feels so uneasy, I wonder how I sat and worked all these days. I&#8217;m out of the realms of the time domain. I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ve sat here staring at the screen thinking how to start. Anyone would have lost count of the errors I&#8217;m committing and all those random phrases I deleted which made their way onto the post even without my concsious. I feel strange tingling in my stomach. May be thats what they refer to as <em>&#8216;insides churning&#8217;</em>.</p>




<p>How would it be if you were to realise that all the while you put your belief in something that never existed. Now I think I know how King Arthur would have felt when he just realised that <em>his</em> Rome never Existed except in his own head.</p>




<p>Love&#8230;I wonder how everything seems to be so perfect but not quite right. Don&#8217;t get carried away because this is not another of those silly college campus affairs or innocent enough infatuations. What I&#8217;m talking about here is about Love and not anything in particular. All I ever believed in is Love. And now I&#8217;m supposed to discover that feelings are almost never mutual. I believed in Love as much as I believed in my self. Now that my faith is broken, all  was left with is my self. Fatally struck like never before, I can&#8217;t even cry. That&#8217;s what I do generally, but my eyes are drained already, I&#8217;ve been crying all the time I&#8217;m alone.Every moment seems to be so long. But it&#8217;s all floating away so fast&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>




<p>With all these thoughts filling up my mind, purposeless, like poisoned needle slowly and delicately making my head, heavier than lead,I can&#8217;t write anything more. With every thought, the thread is lost. I don&#8217;t find solitude in words anymore. I wonder weather I&#8217;m existing still or gone for the good. So that&#8217;s it chaps, more if I ever make it back.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote> I knew she meens &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna talk to you.&#8221;, and I was right. </blockquote>


<p><em>Was I?</em></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know. That girl just walked upto me today at dinner time and said she wants to talk to me. I was aghast. I didn&#8217;t know what to say. My friends were coming behind me to have dinner and I can&#8217;t just turn them down(even if they say it is better without me, I know they wouldn&#8217;t appreciate it.) and sit and chat with this girl. OK! That is not the exact reason I told her. &#8220;I have a presentation tomarrow, so&#8230;&#8221;, I said, &#8221; ..may be later!?&#8221;. But truth be told I wanted to take my time in guessing what is it that she wants to talk to me. If she really meant what I wanted to talk to her, she could have replied to my mail, called me, sent an SMS or something like that.</p>




<p> Why did she walk upto me only after accidentally coming across at the food court.  Does she intend to threaten me, about all this ranting? Looks more probable considering that she screwed up a guy in food court similarly for irritating her. But what is she gonna threaten me about? I guess she knows that I don&#8217;t give up even if I&#8217;m afraid. So maybe this is not so probable as it appears in the first glance. May be she doesn&#8217;t wanna threaten but ask me to stop all this nonsence all the same.</p>




<p>I think I have answers for all these questions. But I don&#8217;t intend to post them here lest she would be reading these blogs. I don&#8217;t wanna give her the advantage in our conversation.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t blog for long. There are a lot of reasons for it. While Couter Strike addiction apparently killed most of the time there is more subtle reason besides procrastination for that. I landed my self in trouble. That&#8217;s what. Some might scoff at me for all this stupid stuff that no one would be interested in. But I feel better by ranting, By writing about it, By crying&#8230;</p>




<p>yes, I cry even at the age of 20. I cry like a baby. I cry when I feel helpless. The feeling that something is impossible gives me creeps. I&#8217;m positively horrified by anything impossible.</p>




<p>Here&#8217;s what had happened&#8230;.<br />
There is this cousine of mine studying with me in the college. She is kind of too much modern for me(may be I&#8217;m too ortodox for her but it doesn&#8217;t matter, this is how <em>I</em> percieve). She got a new boyfriend. I didn&#8217;t believe it when my friends commented. Esp. after fighting and frightening a couple of guys, I thought she would stand for ethics even if she is very outgoing. But I never expected she would <em>fall</em> for some stupid. So naturally(for me atleast) I thought I better warn her to think twise b4 she londs herself in any commitment.(no threat intended) May be I&#8217;m a paranoid but I don&#8217;t believe in these college campus love stories and I have pretty strong reason and a bad experience for having that opinion.</p>




<p>This is where everyone jumps in and says not to care about her. She is only a distant relative of mine and I haven&#8217;t even met her b4 coming here. But I still feel that I should have responsibility towards her. May be because I like to take responsibilities or may be because I got this affinity towards trouble, I went to her when she was with her BF one night. But then as I was approaching them I had this hesitation that she might feel bad. So I can&#8217;t make up my mind and lingered around for a while. Then her BF came to me and started lecturing me about limits. God damn, He crossed his limits and tried to threaten me. I seriously doubt this guy. The way he feels, like he is prince charming and no girl could resist him.. Oh I seriously doubt where all this is leading.</p>




<p> Anyhow I called her up and said I want to talk to her. She said she will talk later. I knew she meens &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna talk to you.&#8221;, and I was right. So I just mailed her everything I wanted to say to her and I feel a little better now. I still feel uneasy about how I can&#8217;t do a thing about all this, but atleast I have the satisfaction that I did all I can.</p>




<p> The most interesting part of this mhole affair is that I guessed this would happen even before I met her. Last summer one of my cousines told that this girl is gonna come to my college. According to her descreption I thought something like this would happen. I even commented that I should keep away from her if she is good looking(though I don&#8217;t think she is, It still eludes me How she could have so many followers). When I first met her, I said She is gonna end up hating me. I knew this is coming but I just didn&#8217;t plan for so early. enough of my rantings. I don&#8217;t think I can write more without getting these killing instincts.</p>
