`What Nonsense!`_
Posted on March 13, 2009 by Confused

.. _`What Nonsense!`: http://retributions.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/what-nonsense/

  It is outrageous that people would invoke their personal sense of morality when dealing with essentially criminal issues. The girl may have agreed to striptease for her bf and  allowed him to film it but it certainly does not follow that she had given him the right to publicly release those videos. The girl’s act was stupid and naive; her bf’s act was despicable and criminal. There is a difference.

  What if a person released their spouse’s video shot while they were engaged in certain private acts? Would it be remarkably different from this case? Would it be then be justified to rant against increasing ”obsecenity” in the society?

  Womyn are stupid.

My take? They are all at fault. Why does one have to be good while another is bad. They all are very bad people. There is a saying,

 *Manchollu cheddollu antu vere undaru.*
 *Avasaram koddhi manchullu kuda cheddulluga marocchu;*
 *Avakasam leka cheddollu kuda manchalluga migilipovacchu.*

 No one is particularly good or bad.
 Need can turn good men into bad;
 Bad people might remain good due to lack of opportunity.

The girl, alleged victim, should have thought of the consequences before stripping(consequence of not marrying) or letting her boyfriend record it (possibility of getting out). The guy should have looked at his own worthiness when the girl refused or what a useless chump he looks if he resorted to sending the messages. Hacking? hacking my foot. It&#8217;s as simple as she gave him her password as part of romantic trust. She asked for it. The guy again is a useless chump ofcourse.

And what&#8217;s the criminal bull shit. The law and courts to me are another bunch of big bullies making rules about what they think is right. So pardon me if I don&#8217;t see why you particularly point out the guy as criminal. Now we come to the guys parents. Why does any body presume anything about them. If they support him they are wrong. If they punish him, they are right. Its the same if the guy is a 5 yr old who stole a pencil from his playmate. As a parent they are supposed to set him right. Atleast try to set him right. And the girl&#8217;s parents. Oh! Stop trying to be &#8216;supportive&#8217;. She doesn&#8217;t deserve it. She isn&#8217;t a 4 year old being bullied into giving up her ice-cream. Either she should have not done it if she had problem with it or she doesn&#8217;t care in which case you shouldn&#8217;t be worrying.

The media&#8230; Ah yes! That&#8217;s an interesting thing. I never understand what it is that it wants. In all honesty I like gossip and glamor magazines better, or even play boy. Atleast they are not pretentious of what they are. I don&#8217;t think I need to expand any more on that. Accept it guys, you are trying to &#8216;sell&#8217; stories. Not educate or inspire anybody. And you guys reading it, take anything you read with a healthy dose of salt. 

PS: Telugu daily war Sakshi Vs Eenadu is entirely different kind of &#8216;selling&#8217;

It was a great ad and and the idea has a lot of potential, unrealised.

It would be great to to take feedback from people. For anyone, not only manthri-jees who are by and large useless anyways. So how would you go about it? It should be simple. A user seeking feedback will sms the question to the server number. It will be broad cast to everybody who will reply to it and the user will get a feedback in a summarised %age and/or number of votes.

Now, let&#8217;s worry about the implimentation. Everybody is not going to reply immediately. So we must set up a time out and/or time slice. In a time out, the user sets a time limit for the question and he will get a summary of results recieved till that time. In a time slice the poll will keep running and the results mailed after every time slice. The poll can be removed when we don&#8217;t recieve a preset minimum votes in a time slice.

There can be more than one simultaneous polls. We can deal with it in two ways.if the simultaneous polls are going to be a lot in number, we could assign a id to each poll and use it to track the opinions. The downside is that the user has to include the random id in the reply which is going to be a huge deterrant. Alternately, If the number of simultaneous polls is fairly low, we register a bunch of lines and assign a unique free line to each line. We can reuse the line when the polls is removed like we discussed in previous point.

If we were to register a 100 lines, it would cost us, by the cost of each SIM in retail, Rs.10,000/- which is not really a huge amount and considering we are taking a bunch for SMS only, it should cost way less. Would 100 lines be enough? Let me put it this way. Is it okay to have more than a 100 polls? The answer is &#8216;No&#8217;. Imagine someone getting 100 SMS questions each day. They would hate their phone to beep every 15 mins. If you have more than 100 SMS, you have a bigger problem than tracking individual polls.

Ofcourse, this argument is based on the fact that mean time out of a poll is one day. For polls that take longer than that, this isn&#8217;t an ideal platform, IMHO. They are better looking else where. Or build a similar dedicated platform. There might be exceptions, and that&#8217;s why we said &#8216;mean&#8217;. Considerable number of the polls are going to be similar to the &#8220;Gandhi or Commando&#8221; ones which typically run for less than 15 minutes. 

So that brings us to the next question. What if we DO have more than 100 polls in a day? What if we really hit it off and become popular? For that matter most people won&#8217;t tolerate even 100. May be they&#8217;ll run out of patiance with an hourly poll. Or some people might even hate us for single SMS. We shouldn&#8217;t be &#8216;SPAM&#8217;ming them in the first place. 

Well, you are right. We shouldn&#8217;t be spamming. So we won&#8217;t spam. It&#8217;s going to be purely opt-in service.

But that&#8217;s crazy. Who&#8217;ll want to opt in? Ofcourse people might be interested in asking question. But unfortunately the same can&#8217;t be said about answering other people&#8217;s dilemmas, unless they have something in it. 

That&#8217;s why we are going to link both of them. You can subscribe to the service as a whole. Not exclusively for asking. 

But, that won&#8217;t make them answer the sms, should we let them ask only if they answered some N number of polls?

That would be way over board. Besides, what purpose does it serve anyway? Other than contaminating the poll results, that is. Don&#8217;t judge people so harshly, there are many people who would like to have a say as long as it doesn&#8217;t intrude upon it. 

So, how do you make sure it won&#8217;t be intrusive? 100 SMS is a lot. Come to think of it. You still haven&#8217;t answered that question. How will we manage those numbers?

I&#8217;m coming to it. There are again, two approaches. One is to tag the questions with categories and let people subscribe to catogories. The other is to randomly select a subset of available people and remove any one who had already hit the soft/hard limit (preset or set by the user). Soft limit is the number of polls recieved by the user and hard limit is the number of answered polls answered by the user. What more? You can use both to make it more attractive. :)

Earlier we mentioned in the passing about the cost of setting up. I&#8217;m sure the cost of the lines itself isn&#8217;t everything. There is going to be a lot of cost involved in setting it up and then there are the SMS charges for so many polls. 

That&#8217;s not the only thing. The cost of answering the poll or even asking a question is going to be a huge deterrent to the user. You are supposed to make it a toll-free line. The operator isn&#8217;t going to be happy about it and will be asking you to pay up instead. One way you can get returns on the investment is to include contextual advertisements in your SMS. Preferably, go local. (nudge..nudge..: Anybody from google local or just dial out there?) Other is to use your userbase to run Commerciar survays, paid by the survayer. Remember we mentioned it while talking about duration of a poll. One caution though. Keep commersial to free poll ratio per user low.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some thing scary is in the air.. like this is the end!
Death? No, That&#8217;s not it.
Death is not frightening. More over, I know I&#8217;m not going to die tomorrow.
This is the result of my years of carelessness, laziness and procrastination.
My own doom that I brought upon, not only on me but also on those who believed in me.
This feels like the end of me.. end of Subhash.</p>

<p>Oh! What have I done?
What am I doing? What am I going to do?
I&#8217;m not sure. But I&#8217;m not going to&#8230;
Let go of my ideals or day dreams, like one might call them.
Step back and settle for mediocre.
Let the past weigh me down.
What I&#8217;m going to do is learn from that past.</p>

<p>This is the one last chance I got.
I know life isn&#8217;t going to be easy on me like it had been before.
I know things aren&#8217;t going to be the same.
But I will survive, and live another day to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Let this be my action plan.
I won&#8217;t get complacent.
I won&#8217;t go easy on myself.
I will never compromise.</p>

<p>There is a glimmer of hope in the air.
The fear still blinds me to everything
and still I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
It isn&#8217;t getting any closer. Huh?</p>

<p>Oh! I get it.
I need to go towards it.</p>

<p>PS: I&#8217;ll give my best at business. And I won&#8217;t neglect my MBA aspiration.
PPS: I guess this is the end of the career options series! Errr, This &#8216;HAS&#8217; to be the end of it.</p>

Time for the example I promised. Lets take a train booking web site for example. It is a typical example a web based wizard. Lets Consider IRCTC The flow goes something like this:

Home Page
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
* To Station
* From Station
* Type of Journey (One Way, Return)
* Date of Departure
* Date of Arrival*
* Class

Time Table Page
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;
* Outward (and Return) Train: Can be selected using
  - Name
  - Number
  - Time and Date of departure
  - Route
* Quota
* Date of Journey (We may want to change the earlier provided one depending on availability

Possible next pages:
* Schedule
* Availability
* Fare
*

This isn&#8217;t an original idea. But I have my own two cents to add and here goes.

The project I&#8217;m working on has a website with a wizard like interface where you enter your details as required on each page and click continue to go through to the last page of the wizard.

Here are some ideas for you if you want to test such a site. You can use selenium_ or any other web testing frame work to do the actual driving. What I&#8217;m proposing is a layer above that specific for the web site. Confused already? stay with me, I&#8217;ll try to make it all clear in a bit.

First of all we need an answer class. It contains all the answers you need for your flow through the wizard. I prefer to keep it flat, but some people like to keep it a collection of objects according to logical section/page.

It is hard to continue like this, isn&#8217;t it? Let&#8217;s take an example. :) That will make it much easier.
