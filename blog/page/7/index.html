of death and the life.

It appears so still
But its a circle that never stops

I stand very near the death
Everywhere round me is the life

Where the light meets the shadows
I came back for you.</pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> There is a Pigeon in our hostel corridor that&#8217;s been roaming around all day today. We have pretty many pigeons and they roam around all the time. But what&#8217;s worrying though is that the pigeon doesn&#8217;t fly. I wonder what&#8217;s wrong with it. I&#8217;m worried what it might do without flyig and thus food. I don&#8217;t even know what I can feed it with. </p>


<p> I thought of taking it to vet tomorrow, but I don&#8217;t know where I can find one in this desert of a city and if he can take care of a pigeon. In fact I must confess that I&#8217;m a little afraid to go near it, may be it is infected with some sort of avian influenza or what ever. I never heard of pigeons catching it but still&#8230;&#8230; </p>




<p> I just can&#8217;t sit in my room and worry about exams like others or play Dota and prophesise that its gonna die for sure. I don&#8217;t know what I can do but I wanna do something. I tried pigeon lovers community and leaving scraps with the members but I don&#8217;t know about the response. I wish the pigeon just flies back home by morning. </p>




<p> Now that I think of it, how is it gonna spend the night? With all of us insomniacs infesting the night can it find it secure enough to sleep in the hostel corridor? I should go and find a place for it, may be on the terrace. </p>




<p> I gave it a few grains of rice and water but it wouldn&#8217;t touch. It&#8217;s shivering. So I left there hoping that it will eat and drink after some time. When I went there the next morning, the pigeon is no longer there. I hope it flew home. (and Harita says its relatives must be taking care of it now :) ). I don&#8217;t know weather it had the rice or water because the cleaning crew cleared up before I even woke up. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><pre style="font-style:italic;">
With all these thoughts filling up my mind,
like poisoned needles, slowly and delicately
making my head heavier than lead.
I can't write anything more.
With every thought, the thread is lost.
I don't find solitude in words anymore.
I wonder weather I'm existing still or gone for the good.
So that's it chaps, more if I ever make it back.

  <div class="entry-content"><pre>I lay in bed,
alone in the dark.
........</pre>


<p>Oh! so many poems start like this, It&#8217;s so boring.</p>


<pre>
too lazy to turn on the light,
and yeah, its night</pre>


<p>Why else would I be in the dark unless you count occasional blackouts! any ways where were we? oh yeah, on the bed. right?</p>


<pre>My computer goes 'woosh'.
I get up with a 'swish'.
I hit the keyboard with a 'tap'.
My monitor goes on with a 'flick'.</pre>


<p>&#8216;woosh&#8217; is incoming IM alert. &#8216;swish&#8217; is the sound of bed sheets. I have to &#8216;tap&#8217; the ctrl key ofcourse to wake up the Darkmatter and &#8216;flick&#8217; is the discharge in capacitors as the monitor resumes from the stdby.</p>


<pre>Its just a silly fwd,
about some two month old girl,
down with some decease,
placed in suspended animation</pre>


<p>So riddiculous that some times when I get this fwd, there is no contact details or anything. How can people be so stupid. Whats the whole point of the fwd then? I concluded she is kept in suspended animation because she had been two month old since last three years I was in college.</p>


<pre>I call airtel,
that's driving me mental.
Sitting in the window sill,
I argue that I already paid the bill.</pre>


<p>I pay them good 1500 bucks and they forget all about it after giving me a manual reciept. They don&#8217;t update the account in database and as I result my outgoing was disconnected. And I have to sit in the window sill because thats the only place I would get a fair signal.</p>


<pre>I go out for dinner,
no one would come along.
I jump on my bike and kick on,
Only to find many more already there.</pre>


<p>So that&#8217;s how lonely I feel. Got the <a href="javascript:togglecomments('alonepoint');">point</a>?</p>




<p id='alonepoint' style="display:none;">
Why doesn&#8217;t anyone come to my room?<br />
Why should I be over joyed at the incoming IM?<br />
Why should I be jumping out of the bed from sleep not wanting to miss it?<br />
Why should I be infuriated to see the silly forward?<br />
Why should I be mad at the prospect of disconnection of out going?<br />
Why didn&#8217;t I notice until two days later when my incoming too was disconnected later on?<br />
Why should I be over joyed to hear the drums being played everytime I get an SMS?<br />
Why should the ringing tone assigned to the one I love be titled &#8216;delusions&#8217;?<br />
Why do I want to call anyone I see to come along for dinner?<br />
Why did I want to sit apart from the others, who came in earlier to the restaurent?<br />
Why did I feel more full and contempt when I had a simple breakfast next morning with some one to keep me company?<br />
Not the questions. They are answers. I&#8217;m not alone. I wouldn&#8217;t feel so lonely in the middle of a dessert.<br />
As a kid, when we lived in a colony on the outskirts of the city, I used to cry every sunday evening when I had to spend the whole day away from school. Why?<br />
Even on a one week vacation, knowing my pathetic health, I make sure to visit as many friends and family members all around the state. Why?<br />
Even if it means that I have to attend the classes with 104 fever, I take atleast three such vacations every sem. Why?<br />
I&#8217;m not alone. I&#8217;m only lonely.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t posted them here because I don&#8217;t find this template aesthatically suited for images. I&#8217;ll like to have text only here. &#8230;and BTW I have a lab exam tomorrow. I&#8217;ll be writing more about the treat later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here is how it all started. First of all I lost my room key.</p>


<p>I was browsing the net and found out that there is a new firmware update to my phone. I went to food court and when I opened my phone I didn&#8217;t find the stylus. Dropped it somewhere.</p>


<p>I almost completed the user part of our sen after two sleepless nights. I designed the project and I was taking care ofmost of the coding. I got it well layed out with work devided to everyone who does any coding in a clear cut fashion and asked them not to touch others&#8217; work. I thought people would mess up but wasn&#8217;t aware of the fact that some one could be so dumb that she could actually disregard clear instructions in plain english and destroy my entire work without touching her own. Entire work gone &#8220;puff&#8230;&#8221; without even smoke.</p>


<p>Yesterday I got my bike repaired and serviced. I was bringing back my bike and meet with this accident. All the complaints I initially had came right back and a few more new ones. As a bonus, I lost my Sun glasses too.</p>


<p>After the servicing is done, I withdrew money, some 5k, from Sandeep&#8217;s account. As he owes me upwards of 2.5k, I thought I can rest without money troubles for a while now. Last night I checked the accounts and cross checked it with the cash in purse and slept, only to find that the purse was stolen right from my table draw no more than just a foot away from my bed. And to realise that I slept as if I was drugged only today for 14hr whereas it&#8217;s only 2-4hr any other day, call it fate?</p>




<p>After all this its natural for someoneto be really upset I guess. So was I. Kanthi was online and I thought a chat could cheer me up. She was as cheerful as ever. We were talking and she is being silly. Something I would have really liked but in all the frustration, I called her &#8216;nuts&#8217;. Damn me. I bet she felt bad. I didn&#8217;t even apolagise as she went offline right after. Okay! When I got time to say bye, I got time enough to say sorry but I wasn&#8217;t really about to. I&#8217;m really making things worse.</p>
