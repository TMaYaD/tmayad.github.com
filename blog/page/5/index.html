  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today evening I tried astral projection. Laugh if you want but I do believe in it and today isn&#8217;t the first time. In fact, I&#8217;ve been trying since 5-6 years. However today is different. I never had this experience before.</p>




<p>I was in conscious trance; I was aware of that. The next step would be to get out of the body. But try as I might, I couldn&#8217;t. I couldn&#8217;t move a muscle, if the expression makes any sense. Suddenly I was loosing control of my body (or the astral counterpart of it). I can feel my heart slowly starting to beat harder. Now the rhythm was really deep and hard. I can feel it all around me. Its driving all the thoughts out of my mind. Slowly even the thought to move left my mind. The rhythm around me is the only thing. I can&#8217;t feel anything anymore.</p>




<p>Then I realized I was awake. No I didn&#8217;t wake up. Its hard to explain. I kind of <i>slept</i> in my <i>sleep</i> into reality. I was feeling really strange. I felt as if the reality I&#8217;m in at the moment is nothing more than a dream.</p>




<p>Though awake and conscious of everything around me, I was still in a kind of trance. I could see everything around me without actually seeing. Its as if my mind suddenly became capable of simulating the world around me. I tried but I couldn&#8217;t move a muscle (this time, in the real sense). My heart is still beating really hard and I can feel my muscle pulsating in rhythm. Its cold all around and I&#8217;m all drenched in sweat. Then came the ache. My body is all exhausted and aching all over; every muscle and ligament in my body felt as if it&#8217;s reached its limit. I was lying there like that for quite some time. I had no sense of time during that period. I couldn&#8217;t even open my eyes.</p>


<p></p>

<p>Once I became aware of the state of my body, it slowly started returning to normal. The heart beat became normal. The sweat slowly dried up, and body came into control. Of course I felt really exhausted and my mind is still feeling kind of dizzy and frustrating, uneasy with strange feeling, but at least I could <i>act</i> normal.</p>

    Eventually, finally, and Hopefully I shall get married!
    So tell me, Why can't we marry each other? Would you please consider marrying me when you decide to marry?

she: (:P) I didn't decide to get married. My dad decided to marry me off.

h: Say, Would you like it, if I go to your dad and ask him for your hand?

s: He would kick you out.

h: Ahh... I'll take care of it all. What do 'you' think?

s: You don't stand a chance.

h: And why wouldn't I?

s: Because I won't give you any.

h: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you like me.

s: Did I ever tell you so?

h: No, I assumed it. Thats why I apologize.

s: Hey, you needn't; may be I should. I got my own reasons and its not because of u; it is all because of me... so i can never accept anyone. I'm sorry...
</i></pre>




<p>Now guys, What could the reasons be?</p>


<p>Still puzzled about the title and the dialog? They say idle minds are devil&#8217;s play ground. This is something that my idle mind hatched. So do play along and find some curious reasons. :) Here are my guesses.</p>


<ul>
<li>If he&#8217;s good and he doesn&#8217;t have a chance means&#8230; If my guess is right, she is committed! </li>
<li>or may be heart broke</li>
<li>or may be married..<i>sakhi/saathiya style ;) </i></li>
<li><i>This one&#8217;s a big story.</i> Once upon a time, she was in a railway station waiting for her train. A couple came running for the train on the other platform but missed it. As the train left the platform, it revealed a bunch of guys with big axes and long swords on the other side of the track. They came on to the platform and brutally hacked the couple to death. Seeing that incident made her mortally terrified of love.</li>
</ul>


<p>Geez, I&#8217;m watching too many telugu movies. Now, it&#8217;s your turn to be creative guys&#8230;. :) </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Too private to put on the blog. Shall let you know when I can. :)</p>


<p>As for rest of the stuff, I&#8217;m done with exams. D in the one I wrote best. And still awaiting rest of the results, expecting an F for sure and possibly two more (out of four exams in total). Of course I&#8217;m disturbed. But nothing I can do about it now. Don&#8217;t even try preaching me. You think I don&#8217;t know all that? I know. But I&#8217;m too weak to fight my own short comings. To refine (or what ever the word might be) my self. I got used to standing idle and seeing things like a spectator and giving up became a habit. sucks I know.</p>


<p>On second thoughts, say what ever you want. But do not expect any explanation from me.</p>


<p>Then, after we are done with that, I&#8217;m back home for vacations and wish I weren&#8217;t. Stupid fights. Mostly my ego again. Or may be not. I really don&#8217;t care. Everyone says, I&#8217;m an asshole. I might be. But I can&#8217;t say that. Again, I don&#8217;t care. Put in other words. I&#8217;m too lazy to bother.</p>


<p>Okay, now I&#8217;m too lazy to continue the post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No more suspense fiction for me. Some how they fail to catch my attention. As I see it, one gets the pleasure in it by trying to get in the heads of the characters and keep guessing the murderer. How ever the process is different for me. Where ever I start, I work the thought all the way back to the author. Instead of the characters, I place my self in the boots of the author and try to think of the mystery. Of course that kills the whole fun in reading the thing in the first place. But some how I can&#8217;t stop at the right point if I may say so to draw enough pleasure out of the thing.</p>




<p>One book I felt was so so was the da-vinci code. The book possibly owes that to the progressive style of unveiling the plot&#8230; like a treasure hunt (wait a minute&#8230; it &#8216;IS&#8217; a treasure hunt ;) ) This book on the other hand was as monotonic that I could have read it backwards without much effect. C&#8217;mon the uber-careful wording in the first chapter itself is a dead give away. Now, don&#8217;t get me wrong. like I said had I read it as a plain story, it is definitely nice touch. But knowing that it is a suspense, it is easy to see through the word selection. IMHO, a good suspense is really un-assuming. know what I mean? ;) </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today the winds are strong and little short of depicting a brewing storm. What is it going to be? Just a passing thing or is it going to lash out strongly across my face? I don’t know how this is going to turn out. But I’m definitely looking forward for the calmness after the storm. Is it to come or is it just another dreamy wish of me? How do I know what is the right thing to do when I can’t even think clearly and blank out every once in a while.</p>




<p>No it isn’t the peace. Its still the dreaded cold. I’m still as lost as ever and I don’t seem to be making any progress. Is this the end of it all? Today finally even I went so far as to ask not to talk to me. To be true, I’m loosing trust I had in myself. My little world is coming apart and I can’t do anything about it save sit & watch or let go off of it all.</p>




<p>Now that we have come this far, let me try to describe myself. I’m a cry baby. I try to make people guilty and get things done on  their empathy. I’m vile and cunning; always plotting and manipulating. No matter how noble a name I give it, deep inside I know that I lie, I cheat, and get things done through scheming and holding others scapegoats. So why should she like me? I never did anything for her. What ever I did, I did it for the impression and not truly for her. The one thing I could do for her, as she asks it, to leave her alone, I couldn’t do it! So what’s the meaning of all the “I love you” s?</p>




<p>So that means I love no one else besides me. What about pinky? She used to love me so much. I ignored her and cried foul when she did that. I hurt others and don’t want them to hurt me back. She still loves me and can’t forgive me for what I’ve done. Some times, you can’t simply plug a hole you’ve poked.  And that is really the reason she hurts me. But still I tell my self that she hurts just because she found another. If it’s one person who hated me, It’s their problem. I could possibly forget and move on. But if everyone hates me, then it’s my problem. I need to do something and I don’t. Instead I just withdraw into myself. When I do that even if there is somebody who comes near me. They will move away. Who wants to be friends with someone who always talks about himself, rants to be more precise, I might have a chance if I’m more cheerful. But Marvin seems to be more cheerful than me.</p>




<p>Let me try….
I will talk less from now on, and listen more.
My phone bill must go down. K
I’ll save more and earn a little and spend less.
I’ll always keep a smile on my face. J
I won’t expect anything, or I will expect like always, but try not to be bogged by the failures.
I will leave Swetha as alone as I can ;) .
I will apologize to Pinky truly and won’t show any excuses.
I will read more and try fewer jokes :P</p>




<p>May be someday after I stop making outgoing calls, may be I’ll receive a few incoming calls.
May be after I stop spending I’ll get a few gifts.
May be my smile will fill joy around me.
May be after I stop being the crybaby, Swetha will give me the kiss.
May be Pinky will stop trying to hurt me.
May be… Just may be…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week has been eventful. I came home, got a new lapi, and even gave my sis a surprise birthday party. Not everything has been what I call sweet though.</p>




<p>To start with I had an exam, a viva, a research report and a project proposal to complete before I could leave the college. I gave the exam which turned out to be as nasty as ever. I gave the RI report which isn’t any good. I got the prof to postpone the viva and I’ve put off the project proposal for a later date.</p>




<p>Then came the nice part. I came home in AC 3tier sleeper when I paid only the fare of the sleeper class and that too with doubt so as to whether I would get accommodation et al. Even the car was placed right next to the place I got down the foot bridge. The journey was uneventful and satisfying with Betty and good ol’ Jeeves (of Wodehose) to keep me company. I gave a pretty good cover-up of the issue and managed so as to not let the word get across to my second home, preserving the surprise element.</p>




<p>When I’m home I got the lapi from dad and got the net going good on the home PC too, There are a few temporary set backs and lapses. For one, I try as I might, I can’t get HDD to take the primary master slot on the IDE channel. No amount of configuration seems to help, with the constraint of the limited IDE cable length which can’t reach from one drive to another and mobo in the way I want, I even tried removing the connectors and re-crimping them but to no avail. So I guess installing OS X is nto going to be easy on this setup. Neither was it on the lapi. The lapi keeps screwing itself up in different ways with apparently no difference in the installation. I even tried many clean installs after erasing and zeroing out the partition. The biggest hurdle it seems to me is about preserving the existing windows xp home preinstalled and recovery partitions while being too lazy to backup the whole thing. Other than that, the custom windows I made at college seems to be working just fine, though it needs a little more work.</p>




<p>The rest is fine at home. I had a spot of trouble with my health back there but its allright. Later I got into fight with mom for her negligence about my room. And dad gave me a little lecture over that.</p>




<p>Then there is the surprise B’day party like I’ve mentioned earlier. It demands another post of it’s own. After-all, all the events I listed here are side shows, while this is the whole purpose of the trip.</p>




<p>One more thing I should probably add is about the problems back at college. The RI report was not good enough for a pass grade but professor hinted me at possible extension (to the dead line) so that I won’t have to stay back for another whole sem. But that’s not all, though it’s the worst. The UMA TA as at it again sending an ominous sounding template mail again for my absence in the Monday lab. Let him go to hell, I’ve already told the prof I won’t be in the college and asked for viva postponement and this lunatic actually expects me to be in the lab? Rats. Then there is the prof herself who wanted to see me and another guy urgently, we must have screwed up the midsem or something. I wouldn’t be surprised and I mailed her back reminding her of my absence. She didn’t reply so I don’t know how she took it. Well, what ever it is, it got to wait till I’m back in the college and breathing.</p>




<p>Hmm, what else what else?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What do I tell about her!!! She is a perfect little angel. For me, she is everything. But for her, Nothing is anything. She lives a simple life. But makes mine complicated at every step. All my fears, hopes, wishes, disappointments, desperations&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;nothing can reach her. She is superior to every kind of stress. I could never be like her. Neither could I stop wishing to be.</p>




<p>For those who can see, there appears a contradiction. If I can be like her, then I won&#8217;t be passionately attached to any thing. I can&#8217;t be so emotional as I&#8217;m now and couldn&#8217;t possibly seek to be like her. So after all I love her so much that I can&#8217;t think my life without her presence. So essentially I don&#8217;t wanna be like her&#8230;..Does it make any sense now? Never mind&#8230;cuz, if it doesn&#8217;t probably you never felt love the way I feel it.</p>




<p>She is the sweetest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. Her eyes speak of all the joys of life without slightest hint of caution. Her very presence fills me with the joy of living. But like any other, I&#8217;m only human. I&#8217;m greedy&#8230;.and I think the needy can wait. There is a void inside me. I miss her even when she is with me. I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m missing. But I know this much, I want her and I need her. She is the soul of my existence.</p>




<p>I know I&#8217;m not any good at creative writing. Neither can I quote any great poets. I read many poems/prose written for the beloved girl of the author. But none of them were ever written for a sister. At least not the ones I know of. This is a gift for my sister, something I wanted to give her for so long&#8230;..my self.</p>




<p><em>Do I love her??!!!!</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>YAY, it&#8217;s finally here. The Nokia 7710 rocks.</strong></p>


<p>I already had gprs and up went the browser as soon as I got it. (actually I made my first call to my sister and my first sms to  my best friend) The first site I hit was gmail. It&#8217;s a real browser test. as expected, it had fallen back to basic html view. The javascript support in the inbuilt browser is not to the mark. Also it supports iframes but is buggy, I had to disable frames support to login. other wise it simply refuses to go any further.</p>


<p>next thing I did was download agile messenger and connect to yahoo and gtalk. Here again there is a glitch. If you connect to both the services you can&#8217;t use the off line messaging&#8230;..</p>
