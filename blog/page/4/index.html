  <div class="entry-content"><p>To cut to the chase, I&#8217;ve came up with this theory that, there are two gods and one of them is me. No I kid you not! I wasn&#8217;t trying to boast to raise a few laughs. I actually believe it. So far I haven&#8217;t organized my thoughts, but I&#8217;ll put them here, once I can do so coherently. In the mean while I&#8217;ll publish my other theories.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got down the bus in hyderabad at six in the morning. The climate was a pleasent one with sun blotted by the clouds. Looking around I felt the familiar surroundings. I felt like I was coming home. with the back pack and the laptop bag, I started walking.</p>


<p>Some thing is different. I can feel it. Its not the same as always. I felt like something is not quite right. It dawned slowly upon me. The place is still my home, a second home that is; But I&#8217;m not supposed to be here anymore. I&#8217;m an alian here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When it all started, never thought it would end this way. Was always a thing of joy. Always feel happy when around. Liked. Wanted to have it all. Asked, if hates. Asked if its okay to be with. Thought its fine as long as doesn&#8217;t hate.</p>


<p>Now its different. Liked even more. Started loving. Unlike earlier, feelings mattered. The fact that doesn&#8217;t like started to hurt. The realization that doesn&#8217;t even mind breaking up did it.</p>


<p>Broke up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve been away for quite some time and quite a lot of things were happening in my life. There is this girl I liked and I proposed and she accepted me as well. We were going out and I believe she likes me. But there is still a lingering doubt how any one can like someone like me. And weather she really likes me or thinks I&#8217;m an okay sort of guy.</p>




<p>Its been four months or so and we&#8217;ve got pretty close. But still I feel there is a veil between us. May be my idea of privacy is different from her idea of privacy but I don&#8217;t wish to hide anything from her, while I expect the same. If we are to share our lives in future, I believe we need to understand each other, but she is still an enigma to me. She is smart, yet naive; caring, constantly scolding; loving, hiding; talkative, secretive!! I don&#8217;t expect anyone to like me. But I&#8217;m glad she does. And doubt if she really does. Afraid she might not. Hope she does.</p>




<p>I know where this is heading. I don&#8217;t wanna go there but can&#8217;t steer away. Well, let time decide where I might end up.</p>

She smiled: &#8220;I know! Can you live for me?&#8221;<br/>

She held his cheeks in her hands and kissed him on the forehead.<br/>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>He kept staring at the lonely rose, pink like her lips, more beautiful than ever, and even more lovely as it sways in the breeze. It seems to be asking for her.<p>

<p>This was inspired by <a href="http://nrambles.blogspot.com">n</a>&#8217;s 55. Though I didn&#8217;t understand the significance of 55 words, I wanted to try something similar. And I ended up with this 160(as in 160 characters). i picked it up because its the capacity of a single SMS. Trying to capture my imagination in 160 characters, not 1 more, not 1 less :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a couple of minutes back, I was commenting on a blog post, which at best can be described as personal life and routine. The post was so good that I thought I should appreciate the author and leave a comment adding my two cents. I thought I should because comments on my blog makes me happy. :) knowing that there is some one out there reading and generally interested in my otherwise brilliant but monotonous-for-most-part life. All is well and good till there. What I suddenly realized was that the comment ran with only one central theme. &#8216;Me&#8217;, on the topics she touched. I didn&#8217;t know what else to write, I don&#8217;t know the person personally to add anything to it. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a judge enough to give advises or know enough to make suggestions.</p>




<p>But still, why should the theme be &#8216;me&#8217;? Why is it that, the thoughts that jumped into my head are about &#8216;me&#8217;? Am I so self centered. If I leave the same content as my blog post, that would be perfectly well. This is my blog and my life. But how can I be justified, if-et-all I could be justified, to brag about my self on some body else&#8217;s blog? What would they be thinking? This isn&#8217;t the first time I did this. If you are one of those (hopefully not) abused by me, please frankly let me know what you thought. Leave a comment. ;)</p>
