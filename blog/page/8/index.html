  <div class="entry-content"><p>huh, Things you may not know? this is going to be hard. Anyways, here you go.<em><strong>5 things you may not know&#8230;</strong></em></p>


<p><strong>about where I live</strong><br /></p>

<ul>
 <li>I modded most of the hostel furniture for my conviniance</li>
 <li>I got lot of dust and old things, including dead cells(batteries, not biological ones[:P]) piled under my bed</li>
 <li>I always keep my towel [;)] near the bed</li>
</ul>


<p><em>The other two are about my room back at home</em></p>

<ul>
 <li>I planned almost everything about the room, from electric and data lines to curtains and sinks</li>
 <li>The one thing I hate most about my crib is the stairs, but it helps keep the others away and offers good amount of privacy.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>about my personality</strong><br />
<em>this is easy</em></p>

<ul>
 <li>I like my PC more than any person in this college and most of the people around me.</li>
 <li>I hate having to deal with girls, well, most of them.</li>
 <li>I&#8217;m really confused about my personality, its like I have two voices inside of me.</li>
 <li>I like to store and index every bit of information: sms, emails, phonecalls and even dreams. I chronicalise them all and index them.</li>
 <li>My love is like a waterfall. Beautiful and fun to hang around. But you&#8217;ll be crushed by the sheer force if you are standing inside unless you got equally strong passion for me.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>I would really like to have</strong><br /></p>

<ul>
 <li>A mac book pro! okay this is only temporary(i.e., till one of you buy it for me [o:)] ). But I dream of a gadget with unlimited connectivity to net, small enough to carry around in style and offer large display(think of halographic projection or rollable display) to please the eyes and exotic music for ears.</li>
 <li>A jet powerwed surf board that hovers in air</li>
 <li>A Samurai sword, a Dagger of time and in general.. &#8220;..guns, lots &#8216;n lots of them.&#8221;</li>
 <li>Mind, body co-ordination. It was decided and declared long back that I don&#8217;t have this.</li>
 <li>This might not make sence to many, but all I really want is a kiss.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>I really hate</strong><br /></p>

<ul>
 <li>Dishonesty, double standards, hypocrisy</li>
 <li>Incompetance and those who support it.(Doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with recent reservations controversy, I&#8217;ve always been against it)</li>
 <li>Who ever comments about/messes with my sister, my Darkmatter(that&#8217;s my PC), my friends and any one I like. And yeah add my work to the list.</li>
 <li>Stupids who think abusive words are cool and generally such ignorant idiots</li>
 <li>One mister Jayanth and another guy I don&#8217;t know the name. I would kill them if I got a chance</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>embarrassing fannish admissions</strong><br /></p>

<ul>
 <li>Cartoons</li>
 <li>My PC and my phone and every other gadget I own; i like them together :)</li>
 <li>Talking to my best friend, Harita, about anything and everything I could imagine.</li>
 <li>My sister</li>
 <li>My sister</li>
 <li>My sister</li>
 <em>That&#8217;s three sisters: Swetha, Pinky, Swarna; Don&#8217;t bother about the order though. Actually I like all my sisters.</em>
 <li>..then it&#8217;s my sister, Swetha. I know I mentioned earlier but I really love her above anything else</li>
</ul>




<p>Leave the tagging for now. I&#8217;ll add it later. Guys I know are busy at the moment.</p>




<p><em>edit 20060415:</em> Here I get to tag people, Let&#8217;s start with <a href="http://asatishc.blogspot.com">Satish</a>, <a href="http://desibm.blogspot.com">Bharath</a>.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Much happened last two days. First dad went to Roorkey and I got the car all for my self. Ofcoarse he did put a few restrictions though, as if I would stick to them! Like Morpheous puts it, &#8220;Some rules can be bent, others&#8230; broken!&#8221;. </p>




<p> Kanthi Called me last night at about ten. She studied with me till 7th. Then her parents got transferred and shifted to Hyderabad where she presently lives. She wanted to meet us old friends. So I took the car and drove to Vijayawada club at 2230hr. We talked for a while and she had to leave. She is supposed to start for hyd today morning. I learned later that they went for a long drive and it was 0200 by the time they went home.</p>




<p>Today morning started lazily. Woke up and sat before TV surfing channels for something worth watching. The phone rings and its her again. She is still in the city and wants to meet. She said she would call others as well and call me again in an hour. Oh! I guess I have to get ready. After I took bath for a little short of an hour and a half, she calls me and asks me to come to Corn Club.</p>




<p> This place isn&#8217;t that great. Can call it good, yet I wouldn&#8217;t prefer it for it&#8217;s high cost. Anyways, I ended up at the hang out fifteen min. later and sipping chocolate shake. Swathi is there too and Sindhu is missing (She went to college.) We chat a little and Kanthi wanted to visit the school. I offer to take them and so its all decided.</p>




<p>From there we went to school met a few teachers we know and a senior, Bhanu Sree (She is another classmate Phanish&#8217;s sister). We come back and I dropped her off at her house after making a short visit to Swathi&#8217;s home and dropping her off. Here&#8217;s a pic of Kanthi I took with the 7710.</p>


<p><a href="http://static.flickr.com/49/109142205_6c49ffb363_o.jpg" title="Kanthi"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/49/109142205_6c49ffb363.jpg" alt="Kanthi" /></a></p>

<p><em>Cute!!! Ain&#8217;t she?!</em></p>

<p>She is a real beauty! And talks like a parrot too. So sweeet!
<br /><strong>Congrats Praveen, you are really lucky. Congrats to you too, dear friend.</strong></p>




<p> <strong><em>edit 200603080723 : </em></strong> It occured to me last night that I never mentioned that she is engaged. Praveen is her fiance name.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Saw the blog stats today and found some interesting facts. Firstly, apart from direct referrals (read &#8216;forcing my friends into visiting&#8217;), the highest visits come from various searches made for wetlook, for <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2005/07/wetlook-do-i-have-to-say-more.html">this post</a> and I don&#8217;t even know what these guys areactually looking for. Apart from that, there is a hit from yahoo search results for <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=mahishasura%20mardhanam&ei=UTF-8&fl=0&fr=FP-tab-img-t">&#8220;mahishasura mardhanam&#8221;</a>. Its in a <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2004/09/spicmacay.html">post</a> I have written about a SPICMACAY event.</p>




<p>That isn&#8217;t everything. I was really flattered when I found <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=new+hero+for+warcraft&svnum">this</a>. Scroll to the bottom of the page or select large images only. Hey it&#8217;s <a href="http://mvfb.blogspot.com/2005/04/making-of-new-warcraft-hero.html">me, new hero for warcraft</a>. [:))][B)] </p>

<p>The Laptop is running OSX86. Observe closely and you should make out the dashboard( cuz I told you so). The PC behind it is running Win# on the CRT monitor to the extreme right. The CPU below that one is not working then and made a lot of fuss till I fixed it with a little of my magic.The PC on the desktop connected to the LCD is on <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/">LFS</a> and XFCE that I rarely use. I prefer to work on console.</p>
<p>BTW, this is my PC. Check out my Logitech Dinova keyboard and mouse. Keyboard is on the desk and mouse is in my hand on the laptop. The mouse on my keyboard and the keyboard on my legs belong to the other PC. Switched them to match the colors in the pic ;) </p>
<p>The rest of them were brought in for some maintainance or the other (mainly OSX86 install, hottest thing on my list). I bet if I start charging for my support work I needn&#8217;t buy my lunch any more. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll earn enough to buy dinner too, and no way near my chocolate expences. (Yummy, gotta buy one right after this post.) I believe that is gonna get me less clients and I&#8217;ll have more time for other work, like&#8230; study for a change. But for the hell of it, I love these tweaks hacks and trouble shooting. I&#8217;m actually in a fix. I&#8217;m going to stop these support calls for some time and see if people are really willing to pay me. Meanwhile I can study for my midsems from monday and work on that long due paper. If people really need me and are willing to pay me, I&#8217;ll start charging them. Seriously! I&#8217;m gonna do that.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There used to live a lion in a jungle, the king of the jungle like in all stories. One summer evening it went to a stream to drink water. There it saw a little lamb playing cheerfully in the water a little distance away on the other bank.<br />
Lion shouted, &#8220;Why are you spoiling my drinking water?&#8221;<br />
For this the lamb replied, &#8220;Sir, How can that be possible? I&#8217;m down stream and you are upstream!&#8221;<br />
Hearing that the lion went mad and roared, &#8220;You are calling me names.&#8221;<br />
The lamb pleaded, &#8220;Sir, I haven&#8217;t said a word&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Not now, but last year you did.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;It can&#8217;t be me, sir. I was born only this spring!!!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Then it must be your mother, it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;, saying so the lion jumped across the stream&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

</p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A value to life? I don&#8217;t know. But cirtainly I have my preferences. The lives of those around me are always more important to me than the others. For the ones I love I can take a life. But I won&#8217;t be giving my life, not because its mine but because it belongs to the ones I love, to protect them, to share with them, to take care of every wish of the dearest. I don&#8217;t have any scale or justice here. Or may be I&#8217;m just too afraid to have one.</p>




<p>There are some universally accepted reletive values for life. Forget about comparing criminals&#8217; and magistrats&#8217;, a minister&#8217;s life is more valuable than his guard&#8217;s. Weather our politisians are worth it or not is stuff for another post, and before I continue, I should tell something about my self.</p>




<p>Two things about me: I want justice. I&#8217;m afraid of helplessness. When I seek justice, I&#8217;m hating descrimination (of any kind). I want everybody&#8217;s life to be equal but it is not to be. So either I have to try and set it right, which makes me helpless (and I hate it), Or justify it.</p>




<p>So here is my justification. The age old formula(which BTW is topic for another debate): Greater good of the greater people. When we value a magistrate&#8217;s life to be more than that of a criminal we aren&#8217;t actually weighing their lives but their other qualities. For a society, a magistrat&#8217;s genius is more valuable than a criminal&#8217;s crookedness. They don&#8217;t give a damn about the magistrate. If you can promise them the knowledge without life, they wouldn&#8217;t bother to save his life. But it is not to be so. Hence we give value to the life too.</p>




<p>What?? You find it rediculous!!! Let us see, How much important is a farmer&#8217;s/hunter&#8217;s life to you? Watch castaway and imagine your self as the Robbin Williams(if I got the name right). How much do you wish for some one who can get food for you? And what about now? Do you really worry if a farmer dies of hunger? Ofcourse we all &#8216;care&#8217;, afterall death is misteriously grotesque. But I&#8217;m talking about &#8216;worry&#8217;. What&#8217;s the difference? It&#8217;s food that is valuable to you. and life is only the packaging it comes in.</p>




<p>This happens all the time. Not only in the case of life. Go to Tirupathi. Every body is supposed to be equal before god. But why do we have different tickets? I&#8217;ll tell you why. The one who can spend more should be earning more. That means he is more productive than the other. By the same scale that same larger per head income is good for a society, The one&#8217;s time who earns more is more important to the society, and hence the need to save him some. Does my logic have any flaw?!</p>




<p>Now on to the always debated death-sentance. I feel it is not a right punishment. The reasons that go usally like &#8220;you can&#8217;t take wht you can&#8217;t give&#8221; and &#8220;You don&#8217;t know when somebody rehabilitates or turns out to be innocent&#8221; form only part of the reason. There are times when these things fail. But when they do, I feel, death is too small a punishment. Lemme say it with an example. Remember the taxi guy who robbed, raped and killed a girl in banglore recently! I saw a plackard is a photo in &#8216;India Today&#8217; or some such magazine saying &#8220;Hang the rapist&#8221;. You really think a death in twenty seconds is a punishment for such a !@#$%^&*(). I don&#8217;t believe in hell. I won&#8217;t till I have a proof of it, which comes only after my death(Sure I&#8217;ll be going to the hell, not heaven). Ever saw &#8216;Shawshank Redimption&#8217; or other prison movies? Can you understand what a prison is like? He is a rapist , isn&#8217;t he? So desperate for Sex, ha&#8230;? If it were to me, I would give him solitary confinement for life time. 6&#8221;*2&#8221; slit is the door for food and a 3&#8221; hole to shit in. Dark and damp. No knowledge of the outside world. No company. No don&#8217;t let him die. Remember promithius who has brought fire to the man? Zeus chained him to a rock and every day a vulture tears away his liver little by little and it grows back every night and painfully too. Pain for eternity.</p>




<p>Wondering whether I&#8217;m a psycho or a sadist? Guess I&#8217;m both. and most importantly, I&#8217;m sub#.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today my dorm net is down. I was planning to get my gprs activated anyway for use over the holidays in coming month and I got it activated today. I was back online again after a little fiddling with the settings. The guys at airtel customer care are obsolutely useless in this regard. I wish airtel gives them a little technical training than training them to say their names so fast that you would wonder for alf a minute what they just said.</p>


<p> The joy didn&#8217;t last long though. The signal in the room is pretty bad and the speeds are worse. I tried hosting the phone in the window, and it actualy worked, though not really good enough. I finally let go of the pc and came down to food court and was chatting on the phone(6600 is really handy). I wasn&#8217;t satisfied yet and got fed up with the tiny screen. I finally borrowed a friend&#8217;s laptop and here I am composing this piece of blog. Oh yeah, I&#8217;m online on IM too [:P] </p>
