When I was there, I remembered I&#8217;m not supposed to go empty handed. But what can I get at that time of the hour? So I plucked a flowr nearby and gave it to her.</p>




<p>Sounds rather stupid. doesn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s how I am. Doing all sorts of stupid things.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I miss Lavanya so much that I wanted to call her. I mailed her and she asked me to call her on 29th(yesterday) at 2300 EST. That is like 0930 IST. So I had to do a night out because I don&#8217;t have the habit of waking up &#8216;early&#8217; in the morning at 9. I saw few movies including Aladdin and played CS to pass the time last night.</p>




<p>Everything in my life takes a U turn in the last moment (according to my grandma it will be so till 2007). I called her alright, but she went to a birthday party. Her roomy asked me to call back in 15 min. But I decided to call back after half an hour.I was waiting to call her again. With every moment that passed all those sweet moments we spent together came back to life. All the times we spent together, all The long hours on phone. The way she used to tease me and the way I flirt with her. All the pun and pampering. I was waiting. What the heck. I dropped off at 27 th min(I know because I saw time at 9:56) and was dreaming that I&#8217;m talking to her and wondering why the call&#8217;s not disconnecting on emptying the balance. When I realised I was dreaming and woke up, its 5:30 afternoon.</p>




<p> It&#8217;s time to make things even. I mailed her that I would call her the next day same thime and didn&#8217;t. just to make her wait in wain.(revenge). She is gonna be a li&#8217;le angry about that next time around and I like it. It feels so nice to pleade her. The way she pretends to be angry and the effort she puts into hiding her happy face( ok voice it is, But I never know the dfference. I feel as if she is sitting  beside me when ever I talk to her.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My exams ended with a Bang today and a shock(for the prof). For my last exam,I returned the empty answer script to invigilator as soon as I got the question paper without even the name on it claiming it is a waste of paper and can be used for another exam instead. He was shocked and called for the subject prof. The prof  had to call me back and pursuade me into writing something. He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up so easily my friend,&#8221;.</p>




<p>Now I don&#8217;t even know what are S,T,x,x*,X,X* in fourier series. What am I supposed to write? I had a little input data on the question sheet and I don&#8217;t know how to process it. So I did everything I can do with the data nomatter what the subject or the syllabus is and filled the answer script with all sorts of crap. Now that&#8217;s what I call a waste of paper and resources.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever wondered what is wrong with you. Why everything goes against you and you can realise your mistakes only when things get carried away too long.</p>




<p>I did. I mean.. I do, always. Everything I plan meteculously, All the contingensy plans I draw, looks and works just fine, that is until the point where I think it&#8217;s all done and would be a gr8 thing. But suddenly I realise that I have lost everything long time back and I can&#8217;t do a thing about it. It feels like the very ground I stand upon and all the foundations I have laid are being washed away by a strong current called fate, and everything comes trembling down. Yes!, fate. I wouldn&#8217;t like to attribute all my stupid mistakes to fate, but still I can&#8217;t reason why the mistakes too stupid not to be taken care of are giggling behind my back. I can&#8217;t find any other word good enough than fate. Try if you can help me with more appropriate word.</p>




<p>An interesting side track, I feel like I have become dumb all of a sudden. I was writing this post, one moment my mind is racing ahead of my fingers thinking of all the matter that follows, composing the sentances and finding right words. The next moment it feels as if I lost it all. I can&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m writing. I felt like an idiot who doesn&#8217;t know any words. I found my self reading the lines I typed till then over and over again. Then all of a sudden, bam. I&#8217;m thinking again. And the sentances are flowing again.</p>




<p>Have you too felt the same any time. Please let me know. Tell me if you know what is/might be happening to me. As I&#8217;m writing this, It happend again. I can&#8217;t understand what is going on with me. First the disappointments and then these dumb feelings. I&#8217;m already insane and now I&#8217;m getting crazy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Why does everyone pretend?</strong></p>

<p> Life is never simple. I know. But why do you complicate it further with unnecessary  putup. Why does one need courtesy? Can&#8217;t you and me live in peace when we know each other and do our work without bothering the other. Why do you greet me when you pass by? Why do you expect the same in return. Can&#8217;t you see that it disturbs me?</p>




<p>Okey you say you don&#8217;t mind a bit if a pervert freak like me passes you without a sound. How about this.. You sit on a park bench and two thugs come and starts commenting about you. What would you do? Walk away because you can&#8217;t fight them! What if a couple of friends comment you. You&#8217;ll freak the living daylights out of them just because you know they ain&#8217;t gonna do a thing to you. Why the difference. Let me guess. You are a coward and can&#8217;t face anything. You don&#8217;t come across the same thugs again. But you want to save your reputation in friends with whome you are gonna share almost everyday.</p>




<p>huh. you mean you are nothing like that..whom are you kidding?? see what I mean!</p>




<p> Allright. You got this girl, who knows you pretty well,very few know you better than that. More than a good friend she is. suddenly one day she complains about your attitude towards her. Do you think she is really offended? *lol* I don&#8217;t think so buddy. She knows you too well to mean that. She only felt that I lack the courtesy. Now why does she care so much about courtesy? Why does she place it above me?? To feel secure ofcourse. to make sure. why? I don&#8217;t know. Ask &#8216;her&#8217;.</p>




<p>yeah, I know, Girls are nuts. Look at this girl. She used to speak with me like a parrot. She is quiter in my presence than with her old friends, but good enough to talk with a new friend like me. It is another thing that puzzles me. Why do you differentiate between people? can&#8217;t you rather use discretion in terms of information!!? Anyhow, the girl was a nice friend of mine. It is only natural that you fancy such a girl. So what does it change when you fancy a girl? Nothing.(atleast for me). I like the way she looks, talks, walks & fights(though I never saw her in action). She comes to know about my fancy for her and suddenly starts avoiding me. What is wrong with her? Do you think having fancy is such a bad thing? Even if it is, Do you think that I won&#8217;t fancy her anymore if she avoids me? I don&#8217;t think so. I wonder if she does?</p>




<p>Here is one more such freaking factor. There is some one(say A) who would like to hide something from you(not necessarily only from you). They share it with some one they trust(say B). Then B tells you the whole thing. Now you feel responsible and tell about this to A and advise A to be aware of people like B. What do you think would happen? A will thank you?? No.. You might be just wrong. look at it like this.
<ul>
<li>You came to know of A&#8217;s information. That humiliates A.
<li>A&#8217;s trust in B was broken. A don&#8217;t want to accept that his judgemant was wrong. He may insist that you persuaded B into disclosing the secret.
<li>A doesn&#8217;t like to be advised by freaks like me. So he hates me all the more
</ul>
So A ends up hating you to any extent possible. Now do you mean he really doesn&#8217;t know your real intentions? No, He does, but don&#8217;t want to accept it. Accepting it means accepting all the three mentioned above(secret, false judgement and ignorance).</p>




<p>That&#8217;s how human minds work. crazy&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Gone!!!</p>




<p>It&#8217;s all up. Today I forgot to attend DIM tut at 11&#8217;o clock once again. This isn&#8217;t the first time  and I doubt if it&#8217;s going to be the last time. Now that means I dropped below the minimum attendance line and unfortunately, according to the seniors,the DIM prof., Mr. Naresh Jotwani is very tough and that makes the matter even worse.</p>


<p>I wonder weather I have a chance to re-exam or not. May be I have to takeup summer/winter course. May be I have to do it next year if there is one left for me. I think I will be kicked out of the college. Just look at my scores. They are sub 2. with all the subjects. Wonder what they are going to be if I&#8217;m can&#8217;t take up one of the exams.</p>


<p> It&#8217;s all over.. Dead end Dead ahead</p>

<p>Enough of laughing. He seriously reminds me of my own attempts at getting a few pics of my angel. Despite my sincerest efforts the fact still remains that I never had a decent pic of her. Or may be no photogroaph ever taken can depict her angelic self. They are just never the same as her presence.
Oh boy, when I see her I go dumb. I comletely loose my self. Dumb as I am, I used to think I couldn&#8217;t get any dumber, till I met her that is. She truely takes my breath away and make me gasp.</p>
