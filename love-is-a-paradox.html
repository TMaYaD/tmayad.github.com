<div class="entry-content"><p>The same old question, why?</p>


<p>Why do you not like me? Why do you like someone who talks sugar coated words when he has the need and toss aside when he realizes the uselessness. Why did you have to give the advantage to him over me, the advantage I gave you. Why did you pass it on to him, an unworthy swine? You wonder how I could say that about him? Try telling him that my opinion matters and I bet he would be this totally different person. I know that isn&#8217;t the case and thats why I am expendable.</p>




<p>&#8220;why do I always go back to him?&#8221;, you ask? because I&#8217;ve been humiliated. Why doesn&#8217;t it bother you a bit? Am I not your brother? Is the world I&#8217;ve been living in nothing but an illusion I&#8217;ve cast around myself? What is the meaning of all the times we&#8217;ve spent together? Are you simply being courteous to your guest which I mistook for affection? Guest I should be. You didn&#8217;t even come to my home.</p>




<p>Is the humiliating moment I was put through a reflection of your own wish to settle the score with me for all the embarrassment I have caused you? Why did I end up like this? While the other impressed you enough to get away with whatever he he did? Do I have to talk with two faces like him to win you over? What about everything I believed in? What about the honesty and integrity? I know, I&#8217;m not perfect. I lie
and I cheat. but never once did I make a promise I knew I couldn&#8217;t keep. And not even once did I go un-atoned for my failure to keep one.</p>




<p>Am I trying to picture myself in all the virtuous unanimity while making an ugly pig of the other? I don&#8217;t know. This is the picture I see, with my naked eye, putting myself at the center of my world instead of you as I always would. I&#8217;ve been humiliated and tossed aside by you and your &#8211;what ever&#8211;. I&#8217;m hurt and I wanna cry. I understand that in a situation like this I would hate anyone who put me in this
pain and angst. But strangely enough, I can&#8217;t get angry with you. I want to, that would make me hate you and make me feel better. Remember the old adage, &#8220;One can only hurt you if you let them.&#8221;? But somehow I can&#8217;t. The more I try, the only feeling I could nurture is a bitter disgust towards myself. Is this what love is? I don&#8217;t know. This is what I certainly mean when I say I love you. But may be tomorrow I&#8217;ll
meat someone else who will make me feel a different set of emotions which make me realize that is real love and not this. We are always moving and we always learn. Then again, It could be possible that this is real love and nothing else, I could never know. But till proved otherwise, this is what I believe in.</p>




<p>Tell you what, If it means to give up everything I ever believed in to be liked by you, I will say no thanks. Yes, there are times when I said and thought I should change for winning you over. But if it has to be leaving the lofty ideals pounded into my head since I was a kid, I would  let it pass. I would rather be myself and be hated rather than kill my personality and be liked. I don&#8217;t know how that sounds to
you, to be told that the one you believed who loved you more than anything else wouldn&#8217;t care to change a bit for your sake. If it hurts, I&#8217;m really sorry. But remember, I always told that I was never sure which one tops my priority list, weather you or me. And yes, even after all this, I&#8217;m still confused and uncertain about it. And if I can&#8217;t love myself, how could I love you? It would be laughable if I let go of myself and say I would hold you till the end. I love you,
truly.</p>




<p>Do you remember my dear,  earlier, when everyone complained about my driving and expressed concern regarding riding with me, I always used to say that I don&#8217;t have any concern for my life and am reckless about it, but I do understand the value of another&#8217;s life and would be responsible for it. I always believed that if I die, it is the end of everything. There wouldn&#8217;t be anything to regret about and &#8211;what the
heck&#8211; the very notion of regret, right or wrong wouldn&#8217;t have any sense.  I can&#8217;t say that now. I can&#8217;t throw away my life when ever I want. I think I told you this a few days back. I believe I should live on even if I have to endure the pain in it. I have to be at your side. I want to take you in my arms and hold you forever. And if you don&#8217;t realize it yet, you gave a purpose to my life. I always said, &#8220;There
is a purpose for every persons existence.&#8221;, didn&#8217;t I? Now don&#8217;t get me wrong. I believe while this isn&#8217;t the whole deal, this is a part of it. And you might or might not know, in my world, there is only a success or a failure. I don&#8217;t believe in part-work-done philosophy. If I fail in one, I fail in all. I can&#8217;t let go of you.</p>




<p>See, my &#8216;Why?&#8217; did give some answers. But they aren&#8217;t complete yet. They don&#8217;t speak for themselves. I want to look more into myself and find what I am really and what I&#8217;ve become. Thank you, my dear, for telling me to take time off to stop and think it over. Now at least I can give a direction to my thoughts and feelings. I would have asked you the same but I know what would be the answer. Ask yourself, is it true?</p>




<p>Good night sweetheart. with love,
subbu</p>
