<div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&#8217;t blog for long. There are a lot of reasons for it. While Couter Strike addiction apparently killed most of the time there is more subtle reason besides procrastination for that. I landed my self in trouble. That&#8217;s what. Some might scoff at me for all this stupid stuff that no one would be interested in. But I feel better by ranting, By writing about it, By crying&#8230;</p>




<p>yes, I cry even at the age of 20. I cry like a baby. I cry when I feel helpless. The feeling that something is impossible gives me creeps. I&#8217;m positively horrified by anything impossible.</p>




<p>Here&#8217;s what had happened&#8230;.<br />
There is this cousine of mine studying with me in the college. She is kind of too much modern for me(may be I&#8217;m too ortodox for her but it doesn&#8217;t matter, this is how <em>I</em> percieve). She got a new boyfriend. I didn&#8217;t believe it when my friends commented. Esp. after fighting and frightening a couple of guys, I thought she would stand for ethics even if she is very outgoing. But I never expected she would <em>fall</em> for some stupid. So naturally(for me atleast) I thought I better warn her to think twise b4 she londs herself in any commitment.(no threat intended) May be I&#8217;m a paranoid but I don&#8217;t believe in these college campus love stories and I have pretty strong reason and a bad experience for having that opinion.</p>




<p>This is where everyone jumps in and says not to care about her. She is only a distant relative of mine and I haven&#8217;t even met her b4 coming here. But I still feel that I should have responsibility towards her. May be because I like to take responsibilities or may be because I got this affinity towards trouble, I went to her when she was with her BF one night. But then as I was approaching them I had this hesitation that she might feel bad. So I can&#8217;t make up my mind and lingered around for a while. Then her BF came to me and started lecturing me about limits. God damn, He crossed his limits and tried to threaten me. I seriously doubt this guy. The way he feels, like he is prince charming and no girl could resist him.. Oh I seriously doubt where all this is leading.</p>




<p> Anyhow I called her up and said I want to talk to her. She said she will talk later. I knew she meens &#8220;I don&#8217;t wanna talk to you.&#8221;, and I was right. So I just mailed her everything I wanted to say to her and I feel a little better now. I still feel uneasy about how I can&#8217;t do a thing about all this, but atleast I have the satisfaction that I did all I can.</p>




<p> The most interesting part of this mhole affair is that I guessed this would happen even before I met her. Last summer one of my cousines told that this girl is gonna come to my college. According to her descreption I thought something like this would happen. I even commented that I should keep away from her if she is good looking(though I don&#8217;t think she is, It still eludes me How she could have so many followers). When I first met her, I said She is gonna end up hating me. I knew this is coming but I just didn&#8217;t plan for so early. enough of my rantings. I don&#8217;t think I can write more without getting these killing instincts.</p>
