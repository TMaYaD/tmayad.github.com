<div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Why does everyone pretend?</strong></p>

<p> Life is never simple. I know. But why do you complicate it further with unnecessary  putup. Why does one need courtesy? Can&#8217;t you and me live in peace when we know each other and do our work without bothering the other. Why do you greet me when you pass by? Why do you expect the same in return. Can&#8217;t you see that it disturbs me?</p>




<p>Okey you say you don&#8217;t mind a bit if a pervert freak like me passes you without a sound. How about this.. You sit on a park bench and two thugs come and starts commenting about you. What would you do? Walk away because you can&#8217;t fight them! What if a couple of friends comment you. You&#8217;ll freak the living daylights out of them just because you know they ain&#8217;t gonna do a thing to you. Why the difference. Let me guess. You are a coward and can&#8217;t face anything. You don&#8217;t come across the same thugs again. But you want to save your reputation in friends with whome you are gonna share almost everyday.</p>




<p>huh. you mean you are nothing like that..whom are you kidding?? see what I mean!</p>




<p> Allright. You got this girl, who knows you pretty well,very few know you better than that. More than a good friend she is. suddenly one day she complains about your attitude towards her. Do you think she is really offended? *lol* I don&#8217;t think so buddy. She knows you too well to mean that. She only felt that I lack the courtesy. Now why does she care so much about courtesy? Why does she place it above me?? To feel secure ofcourse. to make sure. why? I don&#8217;t know. Ask &#8216;her&#8217;.</p>




<p>yeah, I know, Girls are nuts. Look at this girl. She used to speak with me like a parrot. She is quiter in my presence than with her old friends, but good enough to talk with a new friend like me. It is another thing that puzzles me. Why do you differentiate between people? can&#8217;t you rather use discretion in terms of information!!? Anyhow, the girl was a nice friend of mine. It is only natural that you fancy such a girl. So what does it change when you fancy a girl? Nothing.(atleast for me). I like the way she looks, talks, walks & fights(though I never saw her in action). She comes to know about my fancy for her and suddenly starts avoiding me. What is wrong with her? Do you think having fancy is such a bad thing? Even if it is, Do you think that I won&#8217;t fancy her anymore if she avoids me? I don&#8217;t think so. I wonder if she does?</p>




<p>Here is one more such freaking factor. There is some one(say A) who would like to hide something from you(not necessarily only from you). They share it with some one they trust(say B). Then B tells you the whole thing. Now you feel responsible and tell about this to A and advise A to be aware of people like B. What do you think would happen? A will thank you?? No.. You might be just wrong. look at it like this.
<ul>
<li>You came to know of A&#8217;s information. That humiliates A.
<li>A&#8217;s trust in B was broken. A don&#8217;t want to accept that his judgemant was wrong. He may insist that you persuaded B into disclosing the secret.
<li>A doesn&#8217;t like to be advised by freaks like me. So he hates me all the more
</ul>
So A ends up hating you to any extent possible. Now do you mean he really doesn&#8217;t know your real intentions? No, He does, but don&#8217;t want to accept it. Accepting it means accepting all the three mentioned above(secret, false judgement and ignorance).</p>




<p>That&#8217;s how human minds work. crazy&#8230;</p>
